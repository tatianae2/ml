Fries were delicious but the shakes were horrible. It was icy and gritty, gross. My first time experience was good, but this second time around, yuck. I will skip this steak 'n shake and go elsewhere for my sweet tooth.;1;B0ENvYKQdNNr1Izd2r-BAA

We arrived around noon and the place wasn't too busy. We shared a large number of items from the menu.

Here's a list of all everything we tried:

GARLC KNOTS: Really good. Really small, but warm, flavorful and soft. 
RICE BALLS: These were just ok. I enjoyed them, but they weren't notable. 
LASAGNA EXPLOSIONS - I don't usually like lasagna, but this was a nice change of pace from typical lasagna. Moist and very cheesy.
TRIPE - My favorite part of the meal. I don't typically enjoy tripe, but this preparation was very enjoyable. Not chewy at all and didn't have that tripe-y smell that usually turns me off.
MEATBALLS & ITALIAN SAUSAGE - This dish was ok. The meatballs are huge, however, and I enjoyed the tomato sauce.  
SEAFOOD PASTA IN GARLIC CREAM SAUCE - This dish was just ok. the sauce didn't have enough depth of flavor for me and I don't see myself ordering this dish again if I returned.
SICILIAN PIZZA - I'm not usually a fan of deep dish. This had nice flavor, but it was a little doughy for my taste. Everyone else seemed to love this pizza, so it's just a matter of preference.
WHITE PIZZA - This was one of the standouts. The pizza was seasoned and cooked well. I could have eaten just this dish and been happy. 
EGGPLANT PARM - I absolutely love eggplant, but this wasn't my favorite preparation. Too much breading and the eggplant was sliced a little too thinly for my taste. I do enjoy how they serve ziti instead of spaghetti with this dish, since I'm not a fan of spaghetti.
ZEPPOLES - These were my favorite of all the desserts served. I usually don't enjoy Italian desserts since they are a little denser than I prefer, so the zeppoles stood out for being a little more subtle and not overly sweet. Plus, I can never resist powdered sugar. 
RAINBOW CAKE - This was a little on the dry side for me. A little too chocolatey as well, but that's just a matter of preference.
CANNOLI - I don't usually like cannolis and I can't say this one changed my mind about them. 
ASSORTED COOKIES - These were good. They have a number of varieties and I would be back for more of these for sure. 

Service was spectacular. Our drinks were kept full and everyone was extremely friendly and entertaining, making our meal that much more enjoyable. 

We all had a great meal and there were plenty of leftovers for all. I was able to take some home to my mom who's a pasta fanatic and she loved it. I'd definitely be back for pizza, tripe and dessert as those were my favorites from our meal.";18;UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw

My friend and I decided on Mike's, due to the fact that the last time I was there I had one of the best burgers I've ever consumed.  Too bad it was a special. This time I went overboard and got the ridiculous Stack Attack burger.  2 pounds of meat, a bunch of melty American cheese, crisp smokey bacon, and loads of regret.  

The beef patties were moist and juicy and very flavorful, I could only make it through about 1/3rd of this delicious monstrosity but every moment was pure burger bliss.  

Other tables gawked at the size of my meat. 

The service was attentive and fun, the food has been amazing both times I have been there, and the beer was the perfect temperature.  

I'll end this review as I will with all further reviews.  When we left, my friend Erika was hammered and I was full.";2;QKj_fglwc_X1VKQP8oBHXQ

Initially, they had difficulty in getting the documentation from our vets.  I decided to do all the leg work myself - only to be told when I called the vet, oh, we already sent this to the insurance company.  Ok.... So, I had the vet send the records to me to forward on.   Only to be told that they still didn't receive anything.  After a phone call, it was determined that it was in fact included in the attachment, and it was overlooked. 

Six months after our initial enrollment, we are still trying to determine what is considered a pre-existing condition.  We received a list of exclusions on 4/20.  We sent in our initial appeal on 4/27.  We sent in a follow up asking for a response on 5/22.  Still no response.  I just sent another follow up.

Ironically enough, as I am writing this review, I just received a response.  I should 'expect to hear back with a decision within 15 business days'.  Third time's a charm.

Update:  I increased my star rating.  I received closure the next day (after the third attempt).  The exclusion we appealed was revoked.  Now that we are through the paperwork / set up phase, I am hopeful for an easier relationship moving forward.";5;JrXaC8v3CcJ1Vp_KJ2epHw

If you purchase them at the door, it's around $30 which is far too expensive for this museum in my opinion. Some of the wax figures are more impressive than others. If you visit during a busy time, be prepared to wait for tourists to take pictures with their favorite celebrity before moving onto the next section. The museum was also a lot shorter than I thought it would be. If you just walk through to glance, you'll reach the exit in 15 - 20 minutes.;0;0FL7-KzN4LOdrq814cX31A

I never had such a great experience with facial before even in few countries in Europe, I'm so happy to find Summer. She goes above and beyond to give you best treatment and she not hesitate to go extra mile for you. So book her without any doubts she is the best.

However, the change to no Wifi on the weekends is a big disappointment. I always enjoyed grabbing a coffee and pastry Sunday mornings and sitting for a bit to check emails and read the news. Colectivo is no longer my coffee shop of choice purely because I can't get any work done. I think putting in a wifi password on weekends and just giving a 2 hour limit would be a much more effective solution if the purpose of removing Wifi was to make sure people didn't hang out all day.;1;zQr55zgsaDFG-ODT8VM-Mw

We arrived to meet some friends for a late breakfast Christmas day 2016, and though the restaurant was only half capacity, the wait for our food was very long and refills of beverages such as coffee were non existent unless you managed to ask for assistance. I would like to note, being our service experience occurred on the day of Christmas, this may have impacted their staff's capabilities.

I was expecting some spices on there such as oregano basil salt pepper so there went half the flavor. I didn't feel the love with the cheese. I only like regular mozzerella, not low-fat.

The best thing is they have kitties, pups, bunnies up for adoption so it's great way to raise awareness, funds and forever homes for these furry friends.  One more quick thought - prices are less expensive on some products I've seen at big box pet stores which is pretty amazing since it's not usually that way with smaller independent stores.

It seems like by adding these Express Lunch and Dinner deals that they are devaluing their food. I came here for lunch, but was immediately enticed by the specials. However, my waiter pre-warned me that since I was sitting at the table, the time guarantee of 7 minutes would not apply to my meal. I completely understood. I suppose that many people complain that they don't get their food on time. The guarantee is only applicable if you ordered it at the counter.

I actually opted for the $10 three course lunch special. I would not call it three traditional courses though. The Mozzarella Frita was a bite sized portion of parmesan breaded with mozzarella and arrabbiata sauce. Instead of the caesar salad, I opted for their green salad. It wasn't really that great. You don't get a choice of salad dressing as it is dressed with undesirable vinaigrette sauce. Finally, the Penne Arrabbiata was plain in that all you could taste was the sauce and the pasta. It was doused with fresh mozzarella, imported romano, basil, and lots of arrabbiata sauce. The dish could have been better with some additional toppings.

SERVICE
Casual, fast and friendly service. Constantly checked for water and wait time for food wasn't bad at all.

FOOD
I orderd their chicken katsu plate which came with rice, miso soup and shredded cabbage salad. It is little bit over $10 and is a good portion. While you wait for your order, you can grind up the sesame seeds that you can mix in with katsu sauce for that extra touch of flavor. 

Juicy and crunchy katsu. Add that sesame seeds you ground up with your heart and soul into their katsu sauce. Dip your katsu in that sauce. Bazinga. Goes amazingly well with their fluffy bowl of white rice. Mmh.

Unlike other places, miso soup here had a lot of flavor. To my surprise, they have one of the best miso soup in town.

We were excited to see Church's open up by the Cedarbrae mall. Everything is still brand spanking new. Very helpful and friendly staff. 

Hubby and I split a four piece combo spicy with white meat (upcharged) which comes with a drink and a side, chose the coleslaw. The chicken was hot and juicy, the exterior crunchy but it was more like a slightly greasier version of Louisiana Fried chicken: definitely a different batter used than Stateside. Tried all their dipping sauces and felt that the honey mustard went best. The coleslaw had a nice crunch but was bland. Ordered the mashed potatoes with gravy since the coleslaw disappointed; it was decent and had little pieces of chicken in the gravy. The biscuit with honey butter brushed on top was nice and fluffy with crunchy ridges on top from the caramelized honey butter YUM!

3772073;KBGoTNvOoV3ixc8zaaMHnw;7;2016-07-19;5;eqWQ7VfM0rlBSJpPNmbOrw;3;"I drove here with high expectations of hopefully receiving authentic British Isles fish and chips. 

Fish? 
Basically three fancy fish sticks and not the long solid piece of beer battered cod or haddock that I was expecting or what one would receive in the UK.

Chips? (Fries to us Americans)
Slim cut French fries and nothing more. These were not the proper steak type chips found in the UK. They also weren't cooked properly, meaning they weren't golden brown and crispy. They also were not cooked in beef fat like they would do in the UK. Beef fat = lard or Crisco. This is what McDonald's does and we all know that Mickey D's has the most highly regarded FF in the fast food industry. This is the reason why. 

In the UK it is generally accepted that malt vinegar and then salt is added to ones chips. I did the same with the chips that I received, but they were so limp that they didn't absorb the malt vinegar. FAIL!

Coleslaw?
My side was automatically coleslaw. The traditional side in the UK is mushy peas, which is on their menu. I'm sorry that I didn't get to try this, because I've never had them before. Sadly, I wasn't given the option. 

Tartar sauce? Very good. 

Beer? Harp. Ice cold and very good. THE best thing on the table. 

Service? Cheerful and friendly. Very good.

Price? Entree and beer + tip = $20. The entree itself was a little more expensive than Long John Silvers and half as good. I was expecting better. 

I'm sure that there are some excellent items on the menu that I need to try, but my ""toe in the water"" test of the food was pretty much underwhelming. I may go back to try some of the other traditional items, but it won't be anytime soon. There are plenty of other British Isles restaurants to sample first.";8;4FE8md9fMr_jZFNbcOmHsQ

(And this is coming from someone who doesn't like to book weekend classes)

Gez is very knowledgeable.  I like that she gives well-guided instruction through the poses with multiple options for different levels of difficulty.  She's also provides a great workout without excessively long holds and is patient with meditations, without rushing. But what I like the most is that she's really motivating and leads by example.

I wish she would teach more.

I also like the aromatherapy at the end of the class (a cotton pad with essential oil is placed on your chest during savasana) and Saturday morning's live music during class.  

The reason I gave Namaste four stars is because of the Monday morning Zumba class next door which can be distracting but if you put your mat to the front of the room, it's a little quieter.

Other things to note...
- Check in is in the left door, Hot Yoga 90 is next door on the right
- Check-in process can be a bit slow so give yourself some time ahead of class to sign-up/pay/etc
- The class is done in two rows facing each other so there's no hiding at the back
- I don't think you'll be able to book your classes online until you have signed up over the counter and don't be put off if your voice mail isn't returned.

I'm glad I found this class.";2;EltVpc1lAtznA--GlndCAA

Upon check in we were told that the systems were down and given our key any way. We arrived at our room and noticed the bar/snacks weren't fully restocked but other than that the room appeared clean so we thought nothing of it and got ready for our night.

This is where it gets weird: we come back to our hotel around 4AM to find out that we've been locked out of our room because our key card no longer works! This was our first night! So we went down to the front desk only to find out that they apparently never checked us in and were under the impression that some one else was in our room and she asked if we had been inside the room yet and when we replied ""yes and our stuff is already in there too"" at that point she called her manager (she seemed just as concerned as we were to be honest). After some confusion and about 10 mins of panic, we were able to get a new room key and finally make it to our room. The lady at the front desk had absolutely no clue what went wrong and was under the impression that some one else was staying in our room. I can't even express how unprofessional that was, not that I'm blaming her she did do her best and was very polite. She gave us a complimentary late check out but that didn't really give us back our sleep lost that morning.

So fast forward about 3-4 hours: we get woken up at around 9 AM by some one trying to take our room service table back when we hadn't even called them to pick it up. We were asleep and an employee legit walked in to the room with out our consent. My friend had to get up and tell them that we will call them when we want it removed LIKE THE SIGN SAYS TO DO.

We spent the rest of our stay hanging out at our friends hotels (Cesar's, Venetian) and had a great time. Too bad our own hotel was so STRANGE or we would have actually spent money there but we literally went to every casino near by except ours because we didn't trust all their system failures.

***We also had Father's Day breakfast at the aria cafe which was honestly the only reason my stay didn't absolutely suck and I will absolutely write a separate review for them in the near future. It was great!! Clean, bright, pretty, great food, fantastic server, awesome drinks. Literally the only reason aria gets 2 stars instead of one. 

And then our last morning we get woken up by a family sitting in the hallway. I opened the door to ask them to keep it down and that's when I found out they were in the same situation as us the other night, locked out of their room due to a system malfunction. Really Aria? ALL WEEKEND?? Might wanna consider changing OS, Dell is clearly screwing you up left and right lol. 

So upon leaving we stopped by guest services to address our complaints and inform them that several other things went wrong after being locked out. I asked for a manager and the attendant passed me her phone and says ""listen to this, our system is down"" ......there was no dial tone. Meaning their system had been down the whole time we were there. 4 days. It even appeared that the staff was fed up with the hotels mishaps at this point. They were all very honest and courteous which I did truly appreciate, but I don't think I'll be doing business with Aria or any MGM hotel in the future, seeing our friend also had a horrible experience at the bellagio (which is supposed to be MGM's more high-end hotel/casino. NOPE). I'm truly disappointed because I had a ton of Mlife points. But I guess WE will have no choice but to bring our business else where next time. I told my friend to stop spending money at mgm and we spent our last day at the Venetian and had a blast. The MGM group really needs to be more on point or they will lose a ton of business, I witnessed MANY guests being inconvenienced this weekend. I know for a fact it wasn't just us. 

To avoid wasting further time I grabbed the assistant front desk managers business card and will attempt to follow up with them and will UPDATE MY REVIEW with their response. 

If any of the staff are reading, you were all very nice and I'm sorry you have to put up with such nonsense, please consider leaving Aria for a more respectable resort that doesn't force you to bullshit people all the time.";2;bB57eksdXQDrQY16rRHGRQ

 She is a perfectionist when it comes to achieving the best for you. 

I had long hair but it was thin from all the damage. We discussed two different short styles and I shared with her a few photos of the highlights I would like. She gave me two different highlights along side of my natural highlights. She took her time and foiled each section to give me a natural looking head of highlights which is exactly what I wanted .
I'm so happy with it and everyone tells me how beautiful it is. It truly is the best highlights I have ever received.
 
We decided to go with an inverted bob and after reviewing all the photos on Yelp I was confident that she would give me an amazing new hairstyle and did she ever!

If you have lived in America at any point in the last 50 years you know they have good waffles and hash browns.  Is it the best breakfast option you could possibly encounter, well no.  It's just every once in awhile I find I just want Waffle House. ( Fond late night memories from college I would guess. )  It can be for breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever.

So what does this location have going for it that makes it better than the average Waffle House?

1. Lots of parking
2. It's not in a shady part of town
3. It has a really nice staff 
4. They are fairly speedy
5. The restaurant is clean

So there you go if you have a craving for waffles and hash browns then this is one of the better WH in the area.";2;rhE4gLtM0gb3XLwSz6HPCw

WAY different then the Sunset Park experience, in much better way. Granted it has been a few years since I have gone, but I was pleasantly surprised with our 15ish minute drive through ride. 
We went as a family and got some goods from the Memphis BBQ Drive thru first. If were taking the long drive out to the northeast, might as well make it worth it. Plus the fam really liked the idea of grubbing while enjoying the glitter. 
The people at the entrance were very polite and gave us no problem with our YELP check in. You are also offered hot chocolate and popcorn by some very kind but a tad obnoxious teenage boy scouts. We supported the cause even though we had BBQ.
It seemed like many of the sponsors of the light displays stepped their game up. The tunnels of the Speedway also made a nice layout to enjoy. One part you actually drive into the center of a Christmas tree. The supported all nationalities and religions with a little bit of everything. And it didn't end to quick or last too long. 
Overall, instead of running the city looking for cool lights, this is a solid option. 
Thanks for inviting us Yelpers to enjoy the festivities!";1;NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew

The foie gras appetizer seemed like a good idea (with berries and some other things), but then the sweet sauce almost completely overpowered the taste of the foie. My pasta of the day with shrimp, mushrooms, and vegetables was fine but nothing to write home about. In some ways, the desserts were the most disappointing. The waffles with vanilla ice cream and strawberries were bland, and the ice cream tasted like nothing. I feel like this place mostly uses nice ingredients etc, but it goes for eclectic recipes that it just can't pull off (no complex flavors, etc). My husband liked his scallop appetizer and his dessert consisting of salted caramel, ice cream, and espresso (though also thought the ice cream was bland), but didn't find his entree too interesting-tasting (cherry chipotle ribs and mac and cheese).;0;M3g2meevFv7mIxT_JgilxQ

We went during our lunch break so it was not very crowded. As much as I am familiar with commercial center (no, I'm not a frequenter of the Green Door), the location was not readily visible. It's in the middle part of restaurants in the center of commercial center. The decor is very hip using old church pews for seating. The music must have been on a British Rock playlist which I appreciated. 

ON TO THE FOOD!!! I ordered the Oggie and she got the Cottage Pie. Maybe it was because it was the middle of the day but I was informed that I could not order mushy peas (my favorite!!) and the pasties took about a half hour to come out. WORTH THE WAIT!! I slowly cut off a piece of my piping hot pasty, dipped it into my accompanying red gravy sauce and gently placed it into my awaiting mouth. SO DELICIOUS!!! I washed it down with my fresh lemonade (no alcohol since work was after lunch boo!). Perfection. 

I really like that you can order half baked Oggies to bring home. The service was good despite the seemingly long wait for the food but I get it takes a bit to get those bad boys nice and crispy. We will definitely be back and definitely during a time when we can wash our pasties down with some of the beer on tap. Next time, I will also attempt to save room for dessert since it looked pretty amazing. 

In summary, WORTH THE HYPE!";1;lg5f5JPxo6AjHz-EvW1hVQ

A lot of the rolls left a weird after taste. As me and my date got furthe rinto the night, we order more and more conservatively. Even the Chicken teriyaki and General chicken were poorly done. 

We actually got to the point where we just ordered hash browns. Even these were unappealing at best. The only thing I found adequate was the Mackeral cut I ordered, and the vanila ice cream at the end.

About all I took away from this restaurant's AYCE is that I probably couldn't do much worse in the future. Though, honestly, for the following to days, I didn't want to consider sushi again for a while.

The menu was varied and interesting, and the sashimi was delicious, fresh, and perfectly cut. I got the larger plate of sashimi and it was very generously portioned.

It's expensive, yes, but I expect that with good quality fish outside of the west coast. I will be returning for special meals--it's a little too pricey to be my every week sushi joint.

Other comments about the wait time were accurate--definitely go early and have the whole party there.

The BYOB policy is annoying. We just decided to forego wine or sake rather than deal with paying to use a glass. In my opinion, places should either charge a corkage fee or be BYOB only--not do both.

Edited: Went back a second time with the parents and was not disappointed. Great sushi rolls! Simple ones tasted really good. The shrimp tempura was also excellent. The chicken katsu was so-so, so I recommend sticking to fish. This place is a little difficult for the non sushi-lover or non fish-lover, but I really enjoy it.";0;9iNyv-Kf4B748GsL0d4QxQ

I wasted little time in ordering their Polish Boy ($3.99): a deep-fried spicy kielbasa is placed on a bun, topped with cole slaw, french fries, and their house-made sauce.

Deep fryers do such awesome things to food. I enjoyed the snap of the kielbasa here. The sauce and the creamy slaw packed great flavor -- and made this Polish Boy a bit messy. I don't think I had crinkle fries since my elementary school days, so a bit of nostalgia there. I ate my food in the car, so I felt compelled to bring out my ""namby-pamby"" side and eat it with a fork. The bun could have used some toasting, but that's my personal preference.

I didn't get many smiles from the staff when ordering. Not sure if it was just too early for the crew, or if they were just too busy getting everything ready for later, but I feel that a lack of flashing pearly whites must be mentioned here.

The layout of this place can be a bit overwhelming - unlike other Vegas buffets, there isn't any signage to point you in any direction. However, after doing a once-over, you'll get an idea as to how it's set up.

Overall, I feel the food quality is better than other buffets on the strip (although the new Bacchanal buffet is now my favorite!) and you get the most bang for your buck. This place has the widest variety of desserts: pastries (sugar-free included!), gelato, coffees, and even liqueurs. Obviously not everything is amazing; some items aren't that great (like lobster bisque, clam chowder, and cream of mushroom), but I find that I enjoy the majority - enough to feel money well spent.

Also included in the meal are wines and beers.

NOTE: If you're looking for a LOT of seafood, you won't find a wide variety here. They do have shrimp and raw oysters and depending on when you go, crab legs.

Many pools there and cool courtyards. So when you have down time it's a great place to sit relax and unwind. Rooms are really priced great. Very spacious rooms some even with an upstairs. Not all rooms have an amazing view but some actually do. Rooms are kinda out dated but still nice. In a few years I will see this place remodeling to hopefully catch up with the (room) times.
Staff was friendly. From front desk to house keeping. Rooms looked great after house cleaning, plus they are very nice when you ask them to come back later to clean.

The meat: nothing worth calling steak. Thin slices of frozen Chinese fondue beef, overcooked (steamed instead of browned) in their juice, and the result is chewy, hard and tasteless meat. I had to spit it out.

I didn't care for the egg roll, I much prefer spring roll which I thought was included but they must be confused with the two words because in the menu it says spring instead of egg. It's egg roll that they give you in the lunch special not spring roll. The staff here was very friendly and nice.

The service was pretty good and the Restaurant very clean but the food was poorly prepared.
We ordered a few different breakfast items and all had issues. However we were starving by the time the food arrived and so sending it back was not an option since it took so long to get.
My biscuit and gravy scramble consisted of hard biscuits, barely warm coagulated gravy and burnt sausage but my potatoes were great and the eggs cooked perfectly. My husbands chicken fried steak breakfast had way over cooked hash browns and the chicken fried steak was so overly breaded that's all we could taste. All covered with the same not hot enough gravy. My friends hobo omelette was good but his hash browns were also way over cooked and his biscuits hard and covered in. Not quite hot gravy.

Bring your Italian wines, BYOB and cash, no credit cards and sit back and enjoy the food and atmosphere.

This is seriously the cutest little pastry shop that opened up in the Ranch 99 plaza right next door to the Chinese medicine shop (has all the roots/teas in that store). So I love croissants, and they have a great variety of different kinds. Some are stuffed with ham and cheese or a delicious sausage while others are dipped in chocolate or covered in some kind of yummy glaze topped with nuts. This place also carries the Japanese fluffy cheesecake!! I LOVE the crab stuffed potato croquet! It has such a generous amount of crab meat in it, sooo good. 2nd favorite has to be the croissant that has the sausage inside of it. It I love that there's breadcrumbs on top to give the croissant a little crunch in every bite and they drizzle ketchup and mustard on top! I actually like that idea since the croissant is so flakey you only need a little bit of sauce and that tang from the mustard can go along way. The sausage inside has a tiny kick but it's really savory and a little sweet. There's also this croissant like dessert that has strawberries and cream inside, it's wrapped in a spiral but it's flakey just like a croissant topped with more strawberries. Just enough sweetness and cream to satisfy your tastebuds, literally. The cream tastes fresh and it's def not oily unlike other places. I had other things too but those were my favorite so far. But honestly, everything was DELICIOUS. This place deserves some great recommendations when you want yummy little pastries.I deff want to go back and buy one of their fresh fruit cakes there.

We waited at the airport 20 minutes for our shuttle and then had to drive another 15 minutes to the actual car rental office. We reserved a standard size vehicle but they have us a compact (downgrade) which isn't terrible but we paid for better. And it smelled terribly of smoke. I called corporate and they said there was nothing they could do since they aren't physically here and I would have to work it out with the office. We came back the next day to change our car and they still didn't have a standard size like we reserved. Less than thrilled about our experience. I also heard the people in line behind us saying they will never use Payless again. I wouldn't even give it one star but it made me choose one.;0;3OGRT4QzKlN_6pzD-M7THg

I've done my round of trial offers for many yoga studios in town. I did their 5 days for $5 deal. Evolution Yoga, being fairly new to the block, currently has a reasonably priced membership at $49.99/month (2 month minimum, autopay). Of course, this rate may drastically increase once they start acquiring more members, but for now, it's pretty cheap.

STUDIO: Located in the Warm Springs Promenade, in between Big Lots and Savers. Three rooms -- AGNI, VIRA, and SHALA. The Agni room was my favorite because it felt like a sanctuary. The white curtains complement the light blue walls and wood floors, while the large frosted windows allow light in without the outside distractions. Even at night, it felt like daytime in this room. (Shala room is similar, but smaller.)

AMBIANCE: Rustic, minimalist feel upon entrance with an array of merchandise for sale. It still sometimes exuded a bare warehouse vibe, esp if you look at the ceilings, but they attempt to offset it with plenty of wooden cubbies along the walls and a chic center lounge area. The front desk employees were totally friendly and helpful, too. (I've had bad experiences at other studios where they always seem to hire the snobbiest or most apathetic receptionists.)

CLASSES: I tried 4 different classes -- Yin, Active Yin, Love Set Series, and TRX Bootcamp. Love Set Series was taught heated, so you'll get a good sweat. Too bad there wasn't music. Both Yin and Active Yin focus more on breath and patience, holding poses for two minutes or more. TRX bootcamp wasn't really my cup of tea. Felt too scattered. Overall, Evolution Yoga is reminiscent of TruFusion if you've been there, but a developing baby version. 

Oh, and yes, there are showers with pretty shampoo/conditioner/body wash included.";6;HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ

My parents took us to Escobar's as part of their ""see - Champaign has just as good dining as your neck of the woods... promise!!"" dining tour.  This was near the top of their list of must-go's.

The food was good, but not great, and certainly not amazing.  At our table, we had:

- Hanger steak asada 
- Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin (got the best reviews, but they still weren't enthusiastic)
- Sesame-crusted salmon
- Sauted shrimp and scallops

The service was fine, though we were kept waiting for our food for a LONG time.  Plus, all entres but one came out at the same time, and it took more than five minutes for the last to show up.  I hate when they do that... everyone who has their food wants to eat it but feels they need to wait, and the one person who doesn't have their food is left feeling guilty and telling everyone to start.  No thanks.

Also worth noting:

18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, ""for our convenience. "" Really?  I've never seen this for under 6, and usually under 8.  This is so they're more sure to get a good-ish tip because they're planning on the party being difficult because of its size.  5 people is not difficult, suck it up.

$4 Split plate charge.  Really?  This is not a hoity-toity enough place to pull this off, even in Champaign.  Thanks for putting it on the menu, though, instead of trying to sneak it in... at least you're broadcasting your shortcomings.

-

Overall, given the weird choices they make, the good-but-not-great food, balanced with the meal prices (most hovering in the $20 entre range), it's solidly a two-star experience.  I wouldn't return.";6;Ev55kUL77kZk6xCYam5www

Sweet Greek lady greeted us & confirmed that our orders of the Classic Gyro and the Chicken Souvlaki Plate were the most popular. We could see why when our food arrived--the gyro was a warm pita generously filled with the rotisserie lamb and beef mixture, laced with their tasty tzatziki sauce, a bit of red onion and fresh tomato. My souvlaki, 2 long skewers of tender grilled chicken breast, were laid on a bed of delicious Greek-style hot rice which was sprinkled lightly with crumbled feta. My side was a green salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, feta, all tossed in a light olive oil and lemon dressing with select herbs--refreshing. We stopped talking and just started sharing and enjoying our lunches.

The nice lady at the counter came to see how we were doing and also stopped by other diners to check on them, too. We were the first in, yet wanted to be the last out. So hubby went back to counter and ordered baklava for dessert. He knew it was best to order two of the larger than usual diamonds of light phyllo, with a super scrumptious filling. They were not overly sweet, like some we've had, but were done with a delicate touch and made today.

I called to book an appointment, and the young lady on the phone was patient, friendly, and accommodating. My boyfriend and I have been looking for a place to tint our windows (separate cars). He scheduled his appointment after doing extensive research, and I scheduled mine days later. After seeing the tint on his car, I knew we made the right choice. He, too, is very satisfied with how his windows turned out! 

David is very personable and knowledgeable! He cares more about customer satisfaction than trying to upsell you. He explained in great detail about the different types and percentages. After opting out for the inexpensive type (which btw is fantastic quality), he didn't bother trying to make the more expensive types seem more appealing. He then helped me decide which percentages I wanted and answered all questions I had (not many because I know I can trust his judgement). After chatting, I had the option of leaving my car there or waiting in their waiting room.

Before being picked up, I ended up waiting for about an hour with my mom. We were both impressed with the free WiFi, tv, comfortable seating, complimentary refreshments, and overall cleanliness! Don't worry if you don't find a ride out of there, you'll be more than comfortable in their waiting room. 

I chose the elevated series and the quality of the tint is amazing. I am extremely satisfied with how it turned out!! I decided on 15% in the backseat so I don't have difficulty seeing my blind spots at night. Something to consider when choosing percentages. I am able to see with no problems at all, and the tint is still nice and dark from the outside. They place tape over your window buttons to remind you to not open them for 48hrs to allow the tint to cure. 

It was an overall great experience. DC Auto is ran extremely well. David takes care of you and will make sure you are happy with the results. I will be recommending them to all my family and friends who are in need of window tinting.";1;7VauyqQj-EBNwUIAyytD-w

Scottsdale is easily one of the nicest small ballparks I've been to.  The layout is fantastic.  The seats down at field level are a iittle snug - and I'm by no means a wide guy (6' 3"" and 180 so I'm tall... but not wide) - and I do wish they were angled in towards home a little more.  Also, before the game, especially if you got tickets in the first two rows, expect to battle the kiddies waiting for autographs just to get to your seat until at least 5 minutes before gametime.  The lawn area is by far a more comfortable experience, but get there early and set up because it gets crowded.

The food is pretty standard ballpark fare, on the pricey side, but definitely the thing to go for are the Island Wok Pan-Fried Soba noodles.  Go for the teriyaki chicken, add some sriracha, and you get a very good sized meal for around $8.

Also kudos to the beer and lemonade guys walking the stands for not being obnoxious while the game is going on.

Parking... the best suggestion I have in the couple times I've been here is to drive down 2nd, 1st, Main, and McKnight between 75th and Miller just north of the park.  It's all free street parking, but it fills up fast.  Take 75th Street south to the back entrance into the Stadium.  $20 for parking is absurd.  It's why I docked this place a star.

My options were to stay in the airport for a 20 hour layover or get a hotel to hopefully catch up on sleep and enjoy some of NC before heading back to Cali. We really should've stayed in the airport. When the hubs and I parked out front of the hotel, he was able to pull up reviews, and I should have forfeited the fee and stayed somewhere else. Upon getting out of the car, we saw a client sitting in her window smoking and trying to blow smoke out of the window...clearly because she shouldn't have been smoking in there to begin with. 
The lobby was ok, and the front desk employee was helpful. Upon getting to our room, It absolutely reeked of cig smoke. We immediately requested another room, and she gave us the one next door which was only a little better. I checked for bed bugs right away and didn't see any evidence of them. We both slept horribly from the bad odor. We checked out as early as possible the next morning and never looked back. We both ended up with bad coughs from the awful cig smoke that was everywhere.

We weren't murdered!
Our rental car wasn't stolen!
We didn't end up on Cops, though this could also be considered a negative.

I think we both have lung cancer now.

I asked if we could order an alcoholic beverage from the bar, she stated No, If you want a drink you need go back to the first floor & order something from the restaurant. So back down we went. We bought 2 drinks (Bloody Mary & vodkas tonic) our price was $23. We had to wait in line to get back on the elevator. We arrived promptly at 6pm. I again checked in with the hostess station. We were not seated until 6:18pm. There was zero explanation as to why we were seated so late and there were many other couples waiting to be seated for 6pm. The hostesses write your name on a small sticky note and they line them up and seat you by that. Finally, we were seated with many open tables and they were not busy.  Couldn't figure out what the delay was? We had 7:30pm ballet tickets at the Convention center and I knew we'd be late. The view from the restaurant was impeccable & the waitress provided top notch service. We mentioned to her we would be late due to being seated late, I couldn't finish my entree (due to time) so we had to pay and leave quickly to make it before curtain. The food was excellent but we felt rushed. Wished we could have stayed longer. When we left, there were around 10 couples waiting to be seated. The manager gave us a huge credit to our bill. We were very grateful. The hostesses need to figure out the seating situation - once you get seated the other staff takes over and provides excellent service!!! I would go back - but not on a night in which I had another event to attend.";0;Y27jbO3sRW1zjcogYlIU-Q

On the upside: most of the food was superlative. My wife's lamb sliders were lovely, and worth 5 stars just for them, as was my mom's pear salad. The waitstaff was very attentive but not asking me every three minutes if we were enjoying our meal. The fried cheese curds were among the best I've ever had, super light breading and fresh cheese. WAY better than the Old Fashion's supposedly stellar cheese curds.

So far, a solid 4-star plus review.

But...it's noisy, so noisy it was hard to have a conversation with those at my table. Now if this were a review for a bar, it would easily be a 4-star review. I suppose if I went there as a bar patron, I'd feel differently. If you want blaring music (Blondie? Seriously?), check out the festive atmosphere. But I was there as a diner. Perhaps that was my mistake.

Still, let's give it four stars...but then the mussels came.

The one preparation I felt was poor was the moules et frites. In every place I've ever had moules et frites, they were served in separate containers; the frites in a paper cone, Belgian style, and the mussels in a bowl, usually covered. The fries were on the side and a third of them were soaked with the preparation for the mussels. Not authentic, and not very good. The mussels were exceptionally large and would have been perfect in a lighter sauce. Yes, I am a moules fan, so maybe that's why I was sad they were sub par.

Overall, I feel like it's worth three and a half stars as a restaurant. The bar is huge and clearly these guys do some cool mixology. I'd say go as a bar patron and enjoy some sliders, but I think there are better choices for a quiet dinner rather than a night on the town.

Hats off to the chef for the sliders---they were exceptional, but please work on the moules et frites. I'll come back for brunch and give it another shot.";0;A_ud_DdktYLvamC8lLIXUA

It's located on the rapidly changing Newmarket Main St, in what was once an original bank. To enter HBH, you'll be blown away by the decor first of all, reclaimed wood industrial feel, meets vintage fixtures, meets micro craft beer and gastropub style eats.

My most recent visit, I wasn't anticipating to stop and eat, but then I started looking at the menu, I had a pint of Great Lakes Breweries Canuck Pale Ale, and before I knew it - screw it, I'm eating here!

I went with the well photographed and often enjoyed Bone Barrow appetizer to start. Kind of a gross thing when you think about it too hard --so don't... just eat it! A beef bone sawed in half, lightly seasoned and cooked in the oven. Served on a wood baord with some pickled onions, lemon and crustini bread. You basically scoop the marrow out, spread it on the bread and enjoy - and you will because this is every foodies dream and every vegan/vegetarians worst nightmare so be sure you're in the right company if you order this one up.

For my main I went with the Shrimp po-boy sandwich. On taste and presentation this was a winner. A sure fire winner, jerk seasoned jump prawns in a Italian style bun, topped with pineapple chunks served with a side of homemade potato chips. Incredible. My only grief was the size, even after the bone marrow app and eat the sandwich and all the chips I was still hungry. Lesson learned if you've got a huge hunger on this might not be the best option for you - go for the HBH burger instead - now that's a meal. That said, if you love a good po-boy and don't eat like the pig that I am than this sandwich will suit you just right.

Lastly... the beer - this place doesn't stock any beer that isn't from a micro brewery and they come from all over the world and they're always changing so be sure you're checking back in regularly because you never know what you're going to get

There very rude they say you get more with honey and vinegar lol.. Nope not them they must hire professional  a holes!! There is a separate dispute company that you can write to. there is but its a lie too!! first time I wrote to them they said after reviewing ,I got a letter from them they said they would take it off that was 2012 still waiting....Its still there. I have had 3 separate occasions I had over paid them because  they have called and said I didn't pay them. I did a total of 4 over payments because  they said if I didn't pay them they would hit  my credit. Folks I'm here to tell you yet again I thought I call them and tell them please apply the double payment towards my next months. Llmaso ... Never happened  why here's why, it makes it look like I made a double payment I would call them and say,  hey you said I didn't pay you and my bank  show I made a payment and you got a double payment.  You took out twice guess what to bad for me they said, sorry we can't put that extra towards next month. I can't believe it they screwed me over  2 times. The 3rd and last time was I made payments one on line before the due date another amount after the 30 days I had paid them before the day  of payment they still didn't  apply it the last straw was the last one I made over the phone before a major holiday Christmas  well someone either drop the ball or a computer glitch who knows it showed I made no payment but the money was taken out of my bank well before the date it would have been over due. Guess what again they said well have to review it investigate it 3 months later still waiting... Guess what folks you want to guess were they sent me lol... You got it to the dispute  center. The problem  here is my car has been paid off you want to venture if I have gotten any results  nothing nada.  My advice: diligence, due your homework  on the dealership financial  services if they are reoccurring complaints red flag then don't go thru them.  Just like they do a credit check on us.

I had seen ads for Luv and found that I really liked a lot of the dress options so I decided that I would make an appointment about 5 days in advance when I found out my mom would be in town. They were very friendly on the phone and made me an appointment on the day that I wanted. I was then emailed a questionnaire to fill out so that they could get a better idea of what I was looking for.  

The shop itself is quite beautiful and there is a large selection of dresses, but it's not overwhelming! We were immediately greeted by our coordinator Katie (holy crap she was amazing) and we're offered water, coffee, and snacks. From the moment Katie shook my hand she was extremely welcoming and made sure to listen to everything that I was thinking that I wanted. We looked through every dress and I picked out ones that I thought I'd like and Katie also picked a few that she thought would be worth trying as well. 

By the time we got to the back to start trying all of these amazing gowns on, I felt so comfortable being myself around Katie that it made the experience so easy and so fun. The first dress that I tried on was Katie's pick and it was the dress that I ultimately chose! I tried on all of the other gowns and when it came down to 2, I was allowed to take my time trying on each one back and forth until finally it clicked for me which dress was ""the one"". 

I ended up spending about 30 minutes longer than my appointment making my final decision and Katie was by my side and not rushing me whatsoever. It was an emotional experience for everyone, including myself when I had the whole look put together and I couldn't have asked for anything more. I'm counting down the days until I can go back and plan my alterations with them! Thanks Luv Bridal!";0;C-qDvuiPEvjAqoKfDZibBg

It's a more casual setting. My aunts and I ordered the fried calamari and 2 orders of blackened shrimp tacos as our appetizer. Each order or shrimp tacos come with 2 tacos.  Calamari was nice and crispy and came with a size of sweet chilli dipping sauce, great pair.  The shrimp tacos were also good but the taco shell was a bit stale.  We ordered 2 pasta dish to share. We ordered the house made chicken sausage with barrata cheese and rigatoni pasta in tomato sauce and the spicy shrimp chitarra pasta which is made with bucatini. My favourite was the rigatoni.  The chicken sausage was spicy and delicious.  Both pastas were delicious however it came to our table cold:(. Service was great and efficient. I unfortunately had to take one star off for the pasta being cold and the taco shells being stale.  We were too full for dessert but will come back and try it next time.;0;20xtru4h_7TjFn4lSHmSsg

The education is unmatched, the teachers are passionate, and I am so very proud of my vocabulary.

I didn't make any ""lasting friendships"" and I'm not really one to take advantage of nepotism, so I don't foresee any incredible networking opportunities stemming from my high school education, but I really got to experience some wonderful things at an appropriate age.

The most important factor of my education here was the integrated empowerment. This comes innately with most gender-specific education settings, but Xavier really encourages girls to become strong women.

The parochial thing sucks, but as long as Arizona's legislature (thanks, Republican Party!) continues to wring out public education and teachers in favor of for-profit political garbage heaps like religious education, XCP is the top of the tower.";15;_AJwWscnIRVtdxXuYXAHWQ

This is my go-to spot for a healthy and delicious salad when the mood strikes or the body craves...

My top three recommendations, and the salads I typically order are:
*Siam I Am
*Dionysos
*Ty Cobb

I sometimes switch up the protein options and go with shrimp instead of chicken, and if you like spice, I highly recommend adding the spicy avocado to anything you order!

This place gets super busy mid-week at lunchtime, so avoid the 12-1 hour if you can... even so, the line moves fast and I love this fast casual, order at the counter concept.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and super friendly employees.  

Food is fresh and moderately priced considering the quality of the ingredients.  They have a handful of kids mini meal options on the menu too, which are perfect for my toddlers.  I hope to try their catering soon as well!

If you're looking for a healthy salad or sandwich in a super casual environment, look no further than MAD Greens.  Whether it's this location or one of the others in the Valley (or in Colorado, Texas or Utah), you can't go wrong!";12;dIIKEfOgo0KqUfGQvGikPg

My best friend lives here so we spend a lot of time at this complex and while it is appealing on the outside, the complex itself is a disaster. The staff is weird and lacks motivation to help residents. I came with my friend to view apartments here and I ended up going with a different complex mainly for that reason. My friend however, ended up getting a big, beautiful 2 bedroom apartment. I've slept over many times and it's the worst!! The walls are paper thin, you can hear everything! I thought somebody was coming in/out of her apartment every few minutes but it was actually just her neighbors opening and closing their doors down the hall. You can also hear all the fratty college kids partying all night as the walls are paper thin as well. Since my friend has lived here, she's had part of her ceiling fall down and nobody has come to fix it for weeks, and other various little things have gone wrong/been broken and maintenance seems to have no urgency to fix them. The pool area is nice, but they have these weird speakers where management can come onto the speaker and yell at you. I understand that there needs to be some form of regulation, but that makes us feel so weird to have someone watching us in our swimsuits like that. The last thing I want to mention is the cleanliness of this place. It is so gross! The neighbors leave garbage bags outside their doors or in the staircases for days and nobody comes to clean it up! It literally smells like someone is dying in the stairs. I feel that for how expensive this place is, maintenance should be regulating the garbage and staircases AT LEAST. if you walk through the halls you'll also see piles of dog crap and pee, and those too won't get cleaned up. Ultimately, my friends keep asking me what I think about this place since I spend time here and I would definitely not recommend it to anyone.

The French toast was divine, possibly the best I've ever had. The egg batter they mixed in with French baguette made the toast just the perfect texture of softness and sponginess. The omu-rice regrettably was not exactly an omlette with rice, but a rice with a large sheet of egg on covering it. The egg was still excellently prepared, so fluffy! The ankake of the egg & ankake fried rice was delicious as well. The croquettes were also a great choice to share as sides because some of their brunch dishes are a bit smaller than other restaurants.

Friendly, and easy to interact with, even when they are busy.  I tend to get a little torn up sometimes, and when they saw I was plowing through beers, they suggested I order some wings.  Best decision ever.  I wasn't driving, but I like to stay out until I can't see straight.  I had some wings and just kept going.  Then Hank walked in.  I was seeing 3 of him, which made the view worse.  He starts hollering about how good he is at pool, and tossing money around looking for opponents to take bets, which of course is illegal.   No one was biting, so he sat in the corner, alone and started crying.  Loudly.  I mean he was sobbing like a baby.  I didn't want him to recognize me, so I put on a disguise.  A fake mustache and an over sized foam cowboy hat.  I asked him if he wanted to play a game, just for fun.  I thought he was going to kiss me he was so happy.  I beat him every time.

Close your eyes and take a bite...that feeling, taste, all of it is not eating but an experience. Open your eyes & there is music, conversation, art, it is a barrio. This is the neighborhood cafe. I've been a semi-regular since they opened. A fellow Yelp'er & myself came across an ad in a now defunct magazine & we had to check it out. Being Mexican & always on the hunt for good Mexican food, not that water down stuff sold all throughout the state, we gave it a go. I would have given it a 5 star review as I ate. The food = amazing. The waiter became a friend in only one visit. (miss ya John) The ambiance was what I liked. Best guacamole ever. I have had the privilege of speaking with Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza.

The hostess stood by the line, right next to the flaming design entrance to the restaurant.  I approached her and requested a table for two.  She said it would be a 45-minute wait, then she asked for my phone number and name, so when our table was almost ready they would text me.  About twenty-five minutes passed and I received a text, our table was ready!  

The ambiance was modern, flat screen televisions, white leather chair with a dark brown frame, dark brown tables, red carpeting, and orange theme table settings. Our table was neatly prepared with the creative menu waiting to be opened. The waiter also gave us an iPad menu if we wanted to order cocktails, beers, wine, GR Gear, and desserts. For appetizers, we ordered the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers, Shake #5, and I got the Uber Cheeseburger. When we were done the waiter gave us the check and indicated that it is optional to fill out the survey.   I opened the check folder and saw that there was an iPhone prompting me to take the survey; pretty awesome.  We paid and left to continue our Vegas adventure.

::Food::
The Roasted Jalapeo Poppers were presented on a long narrow tray with small shot glasses. Each glass contained a white creamy flavorful sauce and one crunchy breaded jalapeno popper. They were not very spicy but we were warned that one contained a fiery surprise.  Inside was cheddar cheese, jalapeno, and cheddar ranch; the temperature was perfect. We thought there would only be one fiery surprise but I think we got two.  My tongue was burning and my nose was running;  it wasn't extremely hot but it was hot.  It was fun trying to guess which one had the fiery surprise. My Uber Cheeseburger was grilled over apple and alder wood.  It had Fontina cheese, raclette,  and goat cheese; The burger was cooked just right! Next is the Shake #5, it had chocolate hazelnut pudding, coffee shake, and praline cookie. The combination of all the flavors tasted good.

We bought tickets at the door, and right after that, the GM came up and introduced himself and shook both of our hands.  (Maybe it was because I was wearing a Nebraska shirt and he thought I was with the band--but seriously, how often does that happen at a venue like this?!)

The bar inside is A-plus.  They have so many options, everything from hard liquor to wine to 100 kinds of beer bottles, as well as a small (but impressive) draft selection.  The floor was ""open"" that night, so 21+ could bring alcohol out to the stage area, but 21- could not go back to the bar area.  (Judging from the crowd's cheering, I don't think that's always the case, and sometimes if you're drinking you're confined to the bar.)

They also have a patio bar and grill set up outside the theatre, for pre- or post-show hanging out.  The grill is actually really good, and Gregg, the chef, has a super sweet mustache.  Bonus points because he makes his own hot sauces; I highly recommend the Symphony of Horrors.

We took a seat at the bar that overlooked the kitchen and I started off with a 20oz glass of one of my favorite wheat beers; Hoegaarden.  

As we sat there watching one of the employees make a batch of Pasties, my friends and I chatted casually with himself and a few other employees about the place and what was good to eat and such.

Being adventurous I decided to try out one of the many veggie menu items and went with the Chicken Basil and Pesto Pasty.  It featured vegetarian chicken and I was curious as to how it would stack up against the real thing.

It was served quite prettily shortly after we ordered and I dug in.  Delicious!  The veggie chicken obviously wasn't a dead ringer for the real deal, but I felt it worked quite flawlessly with the rest of the contents of the dish.

After that we decided on different desserts and I chose the chocolate rum bread pudding.  It was different than any bread pudding I've ever had for starters because it was chocolate.  Next it had a crunchy outer shell that contained the gooey goodness inside.  I was informed that they were sadly out of the vanilla drizzle that normally accompanies it as well, so that would have also made it unique had they not been out.

It's also worth noting that the employees were an absolute blast to interact with as they were playing quirky and fun songs off their iPod and were just being outgoing and fun in general.  It was mentioned though that the manager was not there at the time and that usually had the place had more patrons (there were maybe 2 other couples in the place) in it they would have had to conform to more ""professional"" standards.  

Overall it's a shame I live so far from the place because I could easily see myself becoming a regular.  Prices after pasty, dessert and 2 20oz beers and tip was just around 27 if I remember correctly.";0;6fjsqDqQU6-Jsue9Gd9YTg
5755465;OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA;2;2012-01-21;0;fObXM8Gdn0iob1tHvhlSJQ;4;"Previously, I enjoyed my lunch experience at Fabbrica quite a lot, so I wanted to take my friends there for dinner one day to try out more dishes.

I remember really enjoying the bread last time, and this time was no different. The bread was warm and spongy in the center. We asked for some butter in addition to the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and that butter was really really good. However, it was a little hard to flag down our server.

My boyfriend started with an insalata di Fabbrica with romaine hearts, pancetta, toasted focaccia. From the description, I imagined this to be similar to a Caesar salad. I appreciated that the dressing was tangier and lighter, which made the salad more refreshing than the usual heavy Caesar salad. 

The salad was followed by tortiglioni with oven baked Fabbrica meatball, tomato and buffalo mozzarella. This came out as a stunning casserole of cheese-topped baked pasta, and it smelled amazing! The portion was very generous as well. I enjoyed the pasta, but somehow, it just didn't measure up to how good it looked. Perhaps it wasn't as cheesy as I would have liked it to be. I also wanted more of that crunchy baked crust on the top, and somehow there didn't seem to be enough of that. 

I ordered the fettucine again with crab, guanciale, cream and soft poached egg. I really loved it the first time, and it was just as delicious this time around! The cream and egg yolk were quite rich together, so I was more than happy to share my pasta around the table so I could try other items.

My friend Sandy wasn't feeling too hungry and ordered a beet salad with prosciutto, pistachio and balsamic. This salad was a lot smaller than the insalata di Fabbrica and they were around the same price. I certainly wouldn't have been satisfied with this salad as my main course.

My friend Mel opted for the risotto with carnarolli rice, roasted pumpkin and double smoked bacon. I believe she ordered it because we absolutely loved our butternut squash risotto from Mildred Temple's Kitchen. This version was definitely not as good. The rice, for me, was a little underdone, as I prefer them to be mushier in texture. It also wasn't as creamy as Mildred's risotto, and the pumpkin flavours didn't really come through for me. 

Finally, my friend Mona opted for a polpetta pizza with Fabbrica meatball, cured tomato, onion, and pickled chili. I tried a small corner of the slice, and it was really really tasty. From that bite alone, I almost felt compelled to come back to try their pizza! Unfortunately, the pizza was a little too spicy for my friend, but for someone who can take heat, it was super delicious! 

Although I did enjoy my dinner here, the prices are pretty high. Alas, there just aren't many good Italian restaurants around where I live (Scarborough/Markham area), so my options are pretty limited when I'm craving Italian food. I would go back, but perhaps not anytime soon.";3;Jt1zgNmwz_jheOSmEsljPQ

Thank goodness.)

There was 6 of us, and yup! We all got the same exact thing, Chicken and Waffles with mimosa's of various flavors. To. Die. For.  The chicken was nice and tender and waffles weren't too overbearing.  The only thing most of us needed more of was, syrup which they gladly gave to us.

Short wait, but as soon as we paid, a hostess seated us. She explained the set up, introduced us to our waiter, Izzy, and let us be. Izzy was very kind, pointed out where certain food groups were, and asked us if we wanted water, juice, tea, etc. I opted for hot tea, while my friend went for water. 

I grabbed some desserts first since we were seated right next to the server entry and desserts. My friend went off in search of the seafood. She got enough seafood to make up for my cost of not eating it. Anyway, next was nigiri and caesar salad, since it was safe. There was a pho station by the soups too. Seafood on my friend's plate was smallish, but oysters were huge. She didn't like the ceviche shooter. Fried shrimp was a bit puny and over fried, but still good. Managed to get to the prime rib/steak area, really good. And the whole time, the staff seemed very nice. Toward the end, my friend got 3 plates of desserts and tried the pistachio gelato. Not a fan of that, but she enjoyed the flan and macarons. I got mini cheesecake with sauce on it, and the tart rolls with pineapple chunk on it...x3. 

Other points to keep in mind, there was truffle mashed potatoes, and lobster Mac and cheese, pizza, and spaghetti. Again, limited on what I can eat, didn't want allergic reaction. Seemed good since my friend got a lot and went back for seconds with the sweet potato mash with marshmallows.

In addition, as long as you are 21+, it is endless alcohol. Friend had 4, I had 2. Plus, a specialty barrista stand for cappucino, espresso, etc.

We ate at least 4x worth what we paid for. Weekend seafood buffet is $43.25 per person after tax. 

We left a fair tip, since Izzy was very accommodating when we asked for things. Meanwhile taking care of a whole 1/4th of the room and a giant table of 20+ rude people and crazy kids. 

But to me, fair price for what we got. Again, especially for Vegas. The slight upscale and decadence and low din felt nice. Enter at your own risk.";0;M0AdqJm5dBpevB0Hwl49Lg

Overall Hotel - ritzy looking everywhere...lots of black and white - Millennial Hot Spot- this is where the cool crowd stays, so expect to see awards handed out for every slutty tattoo on otherwise nicely dressed young ladies and guys.  Great check in experience with really helpful staff.

Rooms - We had the two bed fountain facing WEST side tower.  Decent size room, comfy bed, TV didn't have a sleep button - always annoying if you want to leave it on to fall asleep to drown out the noise from the thin walls in the rooms next door.  Nice staff that cleans the room.

Bathroom - voyeuristic shower that allows you to watch who's in the shower and other areas...you can close it, but not necessarily my thing.  It was dark in there as well, but maybe we all look better in that dark lighting.  The trampy wallpaper in the toilet reminded me of those Playboy mudflaps you see on 18 wheelers...

Pool - we did a cabana at the Bamboo Pool as it was 105 degrees that day.  Nice to have the shade option as it was blazing hot.  We had Cabana #1 - not the best location and in the sun a good part of the day.  Terrific food out there and the drinks were outstanding.  You need 6 people to make this cabana food minimum work, but the two of us did a nice dent.  Pool was a little cold for 105 degrees, but it felt good to cool off a bit.  Water was overloaded with Hawaiian Tropic lotion.

Restaurants - We ate twice at Eggslut, it was that good.  Get there early and not too bad of a line.  Loved the Fairfax sandwich.  Also ate at Holsteins for a milkshake and late night snack.  Shake was good, had the Coffee and Donuts...coffee was there, but donuts...not so much.
The buffet looked great as we strolled through to see what they had, but didn't get to eat there this trip...maybe next time.  Stopped by the Pizza place - that looked a little out of place to the rest of the joint...kind of an afterthought...but lots of the hip kids were there getting there pizza on.

Long line for cab on the great exodus on Sunday.  Also lots of people all check out at the same time.  Expect to wait.  We didn't find out until we got to the front of the line that as Marriott Gold Card members, we could have checkout out in the lounge.   Next trip.

If I have events on this part of town - like the TMobile Center - this is where I'd stay again.  Easy to get to and central location.  Not quite the same experience as the Encore, but it was fun.";2;IDcYXJpo3B62HS40bEXCpw

Sweet Lady Kay had just picked me up from work in Lawrenceville so we could both catch Holy Grail and 3 Inches of Blood at Altar Bar. It was a gamble; I didn't want to use any paid time off since the show didn't start until 7 but still wanted to see the main 2 acts. 

Alas, Kay was hungry, and when Kay's hungry, all of Creation is in danger. My stomach was equally raging. This much was certain: We both needed to be fed. With luck on our side, as we turned in our tickets in exchange for wristbands at Altar, we found out  that there were 2 opening acts to go before the 2 principals. 

The magical hot dog cart which is often outside of Altar was nowhere in sight. I had counted on it. Curses! The frank-peddlers must have taken the night off or were working elsewhere. 

McDonald's is never an option. I don't care how cheap and convenient they are. So are prostitutes. Do cats avoid water? 

I espied a sign that said VIETNAM'S PHO. With nary a further thought, I grabbed Kay by the hand and ran across the street with her to this godsend of an eatery.

We walked in and the first thing we saw were 2 fellow metallions dining, so we already felt reassured that we would encounter no bumps in the road during our night out. The owner (?) came out, greeted us warmly and seated us promptly in a booth, not seeming to mind my deep red and black heavy metal concert t-shirt. I stuck out like Ron Paul at a Workers World Party rally, but regardless of the classy interiors, it is a casual dress establishment. 

Kay and I needed to dine fast, something I hate having to do. Both of us scanned the menu quickly. I had been wanting to try pho since people around Yelp won't shut the frack up about it, but my bladder just wasn't cool with me guzzling down 12 ounces of soup in a short amount of time, so...

I pointed at menu item # 15: Bun Dac Biet. Kay picked #16: Bun Cha Gio. 

I was rewarded for my hasty decision with a groovy jumble of beef chunks, shrimp, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, noodles, spring rolls, and some sort of sweet/sour collusion (collision?) of a dressing that tasted like a vinaigrette. It was an unexpectedly delectable salmagundi of salad, appetizer, and entree that I wish could have lasted all night. An ace ensemble of a dish, the situation at hand unfortunately forced me to gormandize the poor thing, but it was a brief fling that I relished as I would a long-term affair. 

Kay's meal was very similar to mine. She saved those first-rate spring rolls that were also included in her bowl for last so she could dip them into the dressing that collected in the bottom after everything else was eaten. Watching her do so was a delight in itself. I like to watch my girl eat for some bizarre reason. Fetish? You tell me. 
 
I THINK I have finally achieved a sort of competence with chopsticks. The key lies in clearing your mind while you're using them and training the muscles in your fingers to do things they aren't used to doing. My circumstances this evening caused me to learn something I never thought I'd be able to do at all; the equivalent of having to hang glide from a cliff to dodge a stampede of dinosaurs.  

We got our check ($22), paid it, and hustled back across the street to Altar in time to catch the back half of the 3rd opener's set, our bellies warm and full, our ears ringing, our heads banging, the rest of our concert night saved. Whew!

P.S. Vietnam's Pho is obviously endorsed by Hollywood big shot Russell Crowe. I nearly forgot to mention that a candid picture of him can be seen on the wall as you enter.";15;rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A

We zipped over to City Center and of course, with my raging Crumpet Fever, I had to stop and take in the newest boutique of this iconic designer.  

In the last few months, I have picked up several pairs of cufflinks, a wallet, and purchased a new Key Chain from their current Pin Up Girl collection.  Sultry and fun - yay! 

Many thanks to Sales Professional Chris, who was extremely polite, polished and thoughtful, without getting underfoot.   Ask for him by name; he'll take care of you.  I tried on several skirts but they did not have size 38 in stock, so he happily called the SF outpost and put several items on hold for me.  

I will be returning to Vegas at the end of the month for another adventure, so I will be sure to stop by again - there were several other items calling my name, but alas, we had dinner reservations and didn't want to be late!

The aesthetic sensibilities of Paul Smith are so spot on - the devil is in the details, and I am an unrepentant transgressor!  I love wearing my Union Jack Mini Cooper cuff links; when I want to go lean and mean, there's a spot for everything in my cardholder wallet... and the riot of colors manage to be both staid and irreverent.  

I love Paul Smith for being so on point and current without being ""trendy"".  There is a fantastic sharpness that is always relevant and invigorating about anything Paul Smith, whether it's a more subtle but razor smart accessory, pair of socks, beautifully fitted suit or dress.

Always a fantastic shoppe to invigorate your basics or find a statement piece that will marry happily into what you may already have in your closet.  A number of gorgeous tulip skirted dresses come to mind for the Summer Wedding Season... 

Be sure to take your time and peruse the lovely eclectica on the walls - I found that some of things my eye caught weren't even for sale, but gave me ideas for different looks and even cues for home decor.";16;KtUS6HMhgIPHXuwwkwReEw

I know a lot of you girlie girls really like Forever 21.  And, yes, I am a dad and I should not be liking it.  However, I liked the idea, just not the execution.

1. Cool - to have a store focused on modern and basic trendy clothing at a very reasonable price is an awesome idea that F21 has got down to a science.

2.  Quality - Not sure of the quality as it seems that everything there is what you pay for.  In fact , for the costume jewelry we bought, the first several were broken. The 10.50 jeans seem cheaply made and the nondescript converse look-a-likes look like copies. Overall, I would say reasonable quality. You get what you pay for.

3.  Selection - Here, I am not sure how they do their sizing.  Shirts and Hanger items are squished into the racks so tight it is difficult to hunt for sizes.  

4.  Service - I am not sure they practice this effectively.  no one focused own really helping us and trust me, seeing me at the store you would think I needed some kind of help - stat!

5.  Service - At the store for 45 minutes tried on 8 items and did not get to one store clerk. 

Not one acknowledgement, Nada. I say, there are better places to go....but this place is SPECIAL

""Ramen is a noodle"" the simultaneous reply from me and my two Asian poker buds.

Ramen Hashi, the city's newest entrant into the Japanese noodle realm.

Short and sweet, it's OK. Not close to toppling the two Vegas institutions (Monta or Sora) but it's a quality bowl, fast and cheap.

Noodles - everyday Sun noodle variety.  Toothsome, gently seasoned, machine made noodles.

Broth - Basic tonkotsu.  Not heavily extracted but a good porky flavor, good amount of gelatin, hint of garlic and konbu.  Decent quality, slightly sweet soy added.  Agreeable.  The shio and shoyu broths are both chicken based.  Not very little extraction and almost no collagen.  Clean.

Toppings - Well made, flavorful chashu cut thicker than most places.  Very well made nitamago (seasoned soft boiled egg) but lacking deep flavor.

Basic service.  Quick with food taking five minutes from order to table.  Perfect.

If nothing's wrong, why not a higher rating?  I've had better.  The baseline in Hawaii includes shops straight from Japan.  Use of multi kinds of flour to make noodles, combination of different kinds of regionally sourced soy sauce in the broth adds up to complexity approaching the great shops of Japan, not to mention having had it at the best of the motherland.  That said, this is still plenty good and will probably satisfy most any ramen craving.";37;oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ

I would definitely order it again. It was tastier than ceviche at seafood or Mexican restaurants. Don't be too dissuaded by eating raw fish at the theaters...

Love this place.  The menu is different and amazing with a strong Hispanic influence.   This is not your regular ""egg and potato"" hash house.  The menu has been thoughtfully prepared, the food is fresh and full of flavor and the presentation is pretty enough to take a picture of it.

The Kitchen Table is a small restaurant and seating is ""intimate"" (meaning close to each other).  The menu is remarkable.  Fresh baked pastries are delicious.  The uniquely prepared and presented food items are fresh, not run-of-the-mill, unique combinations that are not to be missed.   Service is attentive and friendly.  The only ""dings"" I can tell you about is that seating is tight and the coffee isn't as good as it could be - its not awful by any means, but the coffee doesn't live up to the amazing food, hence 4 stars instead of 5.

There are pastries, delicious plated breakfasts unlike anything you will find elsewhere.  My favorites include a marvelous  pork green chile  with house potato, pork green chile, two poached eggs, cilantro onions with lime and corn tortilla chips .  

Only on Sat and Sun can one experience the flavorful chili colorado braised pork, mexican chilies, charred tortillas, lime cilantro onions, pickled radish, pickled jalapenos, served in a small pan. The blend of flavors are so tasty and the servings are deceivingly large.      

Benedicts are among my favorites and  while they are all delicious I can heartily recommend the Pork Belly Bene smoked pork belly, jalapeno hollandaise, english muffin, and house potatoes  or the Country Bene  which is a country fried steak, poached eggs, chipotle gravy,
biscuits, arugula and house potatoes seasoned with a perfect spiced gravy.    Very different than the ingredients sound - the Chef has created a wonderful food experience.

A variety of mimosas are available on the weekend - orange, blackberry, prickly pear ,guava  ,  peach,  pineapple,  and cranberry in addition to champagne and a variety of beers.   I've had the pear and blackberry, cold, delicious and refreshing with brunch.   Chefs Antonio and Javier have done a great job with creating a menu with flavor nuances that one wishes to experience repeatedly.   We commend the Kitchen Table to you for  breakfast, lunch or brunch without reservation.

If you don't like the occasional crowd and happen not to like the genre of music that happens to be playing on the stage, then obviously the Terrace is not the place for you in the evening.

For anyone without a stick up his or her ass, this is a great location to grab a quick meal at lunchtime - the burgers, brats, and chicken sandwiches are inexpensive and better than what you can get inside the building. While you're at it, help yourself to one of the beers they have on tap or a delicious pink lemonade. I like to just grab a bite, then hang out all afternoon getting some work done on my laptop. The people-watching is about as good as you'll find in Madison during the summer.

Sometimes I'll take a walk out onto the swimming pier and jump in for a little while. The lifeguards and regulars are friendly.

Once the sun sets, the bands start playing, and usually there is something worth listening to. On Mondays, they even have movies that play up on the stage for free. These are usually classics like Caddyshack or something more family-friendly.";1;1phzsrzdfHi84bwxBCpu_A

Off the strip, not overcrowded, classy but not pretentious. Those who say that service is slow clearly don't go to many wine bars. It's not a turn and burn kind of place. You choose your experience. You can buy the card for $5 (which you get to keep) and load it and taste or get a glass or bottle of wine and relax. I highly recommend buying a bottle. You get 30% off and the bottle prices are very reasonable. My husband and I stopped by to check it out after dinner and only drank half the bottle we ordered so we corked it and took it home with us. There was an amazing singer the night we were there who was a pleasure to listen to, without overpowering the place.

The excuse is always "" we are out of food because we make everything from scratch and our food is fresh""... From my understanding,  most good successful restaurants do that, I don't think that's a very good excuse to always be out of food, especially if you're business is serving food.

My friend had nails that have grown out, 3 weeks old, and it was time for a fill. There was minimal lifting on a few of her nails and obvious grow out; because of said lifting the ""tech"" decided they needed to be completely removed and redone. I think that alone is bullshit, my tech who I have seen many times files and clips the lifting   and includes that in part of the fill, but whatever! You wanna take them off take em' off.

I find in other independant coffeee shops, their small is closer to 12-14ounces. The coffee was strong, if you like starbucks, you will like this coffee. I personally I prefer more flavourful/milder blends. 

The food options were a little on the higher side, and nothing in particular stood out at me. They do have cookies, sandwiches, that kind of thing.

Because I checked in on Yelp, we were rewarded with free edamame!  We also ordered the tempura shrimp and vegetables as a starter.  The serving was small, and the tempura seemed less crisp than what I have experienced, but it tasted fine.
For my entree, I ordered the vegetables and buckwheat noodles.  My friend ordered the same with shrimp.  And, of course I asked for hot sauce.

We immediately ordered a large sushi platter, with two signature rolls--- the fire attack and gold star rolls. In short, excellent value, delicious, fresh, and well-made sushi. The platter had a decent variety ranging from your salmon nigiri to rainbow rolls and futo maki. The Fire Attack roll arrived at our table aflame and was an enjoyable bite of smokey, savoury, sweet, and crunchy all in one.  That night, they also served tables grilled cod cheek? I believe, which was also a welcome addition. After everything was said and done, bill came just under what we'd normally spend at an AYCE, but I'd say the quality well above the average AYCE. For that, this place comes recommended.;0;iCMGR_a7BuFPqZBw-IPNiA

I have known Clarence for 4 years, so thought it couldn't be true, but unfortunately as soon as I got too close, as in paid him $300 for training, he tried to scam me. He asked to ""borrow"" $300-$400 and said he would pay me back in a couple days. Thank goodness for Yelp and the helpful people on here who wrote these honest reviews! I checked him out and didn't loan him the money! I am still out $300 though, since I paid him for training and used 1 session! After reaching out to Clarence about a refund, I got the run around and he wanted to discuss his work ethic rather than pay me my money. I reached out to the owner of Live Jacked Training Studio which is where he's training now. Michael was great and tried to be super helpful, except that Clarence only rents space there. He is not an employee of the gym, so I didn't feel right about posting a negative review on their Yelp account. Anyway, women & men should watch out for this guy! Bad news!";1;z0m4389sbagTdo6QDXeKOA

We wanted to enjoy our party and not think about the work involved to feed 100ish people, fill the coolers, and chase down empties. 

We contacted Chef Michael and explained our vision and immediately received a proposal with a stellar menu and all the notes that met our needs: staffing for the food, bussing, bartending... the works! 

I was excited leading up to the party, and I can tell you that we were blown away by the professionalism, knowledge, affability of the staff and genuine care for their guests. Fully self-contained and beautifully crafted displays, bar, furnishings, everything. They came to the house and looked at the spaces and made an easy-flowing, guest-centric setup that could not be beat.

The food was fresh and tasty, and every care was taken to gauge the crowd and their tastes; the dishes were rotated regularly and were set up by stations.

The variety was surprisingly broad considering the work that it takes to manage so much: beautifully grilled Chianti skirt steak, sous-vide salmon filets, the juiciest chicken, and all with the freshest veg and orzo and salad.

These folks were with us for 10 hours and never faltered. Gracious and hard-working until the very end. They also filled our patio coolers with drinks and left us with perfectly packaged leftovers!

It reminds me a lot of sour cream but slightly different texture.  For dinner, I had the Kafka (sp?), which is 2 skewers of lamb/beef sausages, served with rice.  Keep in mind this dish does have some heat!  The place is kid friendly and has a cool gyro platter.  My son also was gobbling down the pita triangles, which were fresh and amazing.

- A relatively diverse list of interesting, lesser-known wines (i.e. not the same ones you see prominently displayed at the SAQ). Check. Bonus points: The list has mostly bio-dynamic, natural wines. I've found a great bottle every time I've been here. Most recently, an intriguing Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire.

- A good selection of food that pairs well with wine, ranging from light and small to rich. Check. My favourite is the roasted beet, Greek celery, and goat cheese salad, probably the lightest thing on the menu. Their homemade charcuteries are also amazing, it's hard to go wrong with the cheese, and my friends loved the lobster tarte (I tried a bite - delish, rich).

- Cozy atmosphere, good for relaxing and chatting. Check. Chalkboard-chic, modern dcor.

- Good service, knowledge and friendly servers. Partial check. The service isn't always the most attentive, and can be on the slow side.  But I wasn't in any particular hurry and it didn't really bother me.

- Reasonable prices. Check. Not cheap, but reasonable in the context of Montreal, I would say.

So many things stood out about this hotel! 

Loved the location! It was a quick 16 minutes from the ice rink! There are numerous shops and restaurant within walking distance!! (We went to Hickory Tavern and highly recommend it.)

Loved the look of the hotel! Very modern with awesome finishes! Beautiful hallway carpet, tiles and wallpaper. VERY CLEAN!!!!

Loved our King suite! Comfortable bed! Large shower. Separate toilet (water closet) from shower. Small fridge and microwave. Separate seating area was nice when I wanted to go to bed and my husband wanted to watch TV.

Amenities included FREE HOT BREAKFAST (always a huge bonus in our book). Gym and pool (which we didn't utilize but liked the option). Small area with snacks near front desk. Yes, overpriced but still available if needed. 

As for the hot breakfast, it was fantastic! Today for hot options they had cheese omelets and pork sausage links (both very good), assorted bagels, breads and muffins, cold cereal, oatmeal with variety of toppings, fresh fruit (apples and bananas), juices and coffee. 

THE ONLY NEGATIVE was that there was a HUGE swim team there. All. At. Once. Literally, 100+ kids. It was a circus. And they had ALL their bags down there literally blocking off a huge walkway. I am quite surprised that the chaperones didn't have the kids come down in a few different shifts. I wish I took a picture because it was absolutely insane. We took our breakfast back up to the room (before we had an anxiety attack from the crowd).

My suggestion to the hotel would be to get a conveyer-type toaster it would allow for quicker toasting with large groups. They currently had a small 4 slot toaster, which (1) took forever to toast, (2) was in a crowded corner, (3) had a HUGE line waiting for it. My bagel, despite being in for quite awhile was barely warm but because of the line behind me, I didn't want to wait even longer. 

Staff was friendly.

I've gone into the Kensington location maybe twice. The cupcakes are darling and the store has that retro feel to it, that is also very cute. The service was not exactly rude, but not very friendly - just short and hurried.  All the other times I walked by on a weekend, it was closed after being open only a couple of hours because they had sold out.

As for the cupcakes...they are decent.  I don't find the cake part itself very impressive; it basically tastes like any homemade cake that you can get anywhere or make yourself.  The icing is what has really put Crave on the map - it's sinfully sweet (like almost too sinfully; I wish they'd lean a bit more to the un-sinfully side of things), ultra cute and fluffy.  They are not shy with the icing - which is mostly good because there is nothing wose than stingy icing, but they've gone a little overboard.  In fact, I can normally eat only half of a cupcake in one sitting before the sugar overload sets in.  I admit they are tasty, but I just don't think they are ""to die for"" or worth the price. 

As a side note, If the store is so popular that they are often closed hours before closing time (for years now) because they've sold out, maybe they should use that money and invest in putting out a higher volume of product? 

I know it's a super trendy spot, but I don't think it lives up to the hype enough to make it worthwhile.";3;KEYpAE_iHEwFJrEihvZjzQ

Not one person greets you. Not one. Not one person asks you if you need any help. Not one. And to top it off, today I got the worst attitude from two of their cashiers ( the short white middle-aged woman who appeared a bit rough around the edges and the young skinny black girl with short hair). First off, I wasn't even greeted when I came up to the register. I said 'hello, how are you?' to the cashier (the white lady) and she didn't even answer back, but seemed really annoyed. She didn't even look at me or make eye contact with me. Just started ringing and bagging me up, with this stoic 'I hate my job' look on her face. As I was putting my bagged items into my cart, I turned around and she was gone. In her place was the black girl. She didn't say hi either. After ringing me up and giving me my total, I swiped my card and put in my pin. The pin was wrong. I had just gotten this card and I thought I had memorized my pin number, but I guess not. My phone (that had my pin on it) was in my car, so I asked if I could run out and get it. The black girl rolled her eyes at me and exhibited complete and utter displeasure towards my question, as if I completely ruined her day. And she didn't even answer the question, she just sat there, rolling her eyes, hesitating as if, in that very moment, a magical money-fairy would come down and zap cash into my pockets with her magic wand. I asked her again, if it would be ok to grab my phone, and she eventually said that it was fine, but with this hideous attitude. So I ran out and grabbed my phone, which literally took less than a minute (the Spouts parking is an empty void most of the time, so snagging a parking spot right out front isn't that hard). Anyhow, I get back and the white lady is standing there again. I'm thinking, 'oh great, not her again' and of course, her reaction towards the situation is to be completely patronizing. Finally I leave. I mean seriously? I'm a regular customer here. My husband and I shop here every other Thursday. A little respect would be nice. It was already shameful enough that I had forgotten my pin number and had to run out to my car and grab my phone, holding up the line. Then to feel degraded by these incompetent nimrods on top of it. . . . well that was just completely unacceptable. Needless to say, I'm disgusted. My husband and I will be joining our local buying clubs (a far better option) anyway, so thankfully I won't have to put up with them much longer. 

P.S. in case anyone is wondering why I didn't just charge my card. Well, because I don't like doing that. I'm looking out for businesses that I happen to support such as whole food markets like Sprouts. I would rather my retailer not have to pay a fee to the bank every time I charge my debit card. But, I guess it doesn't matter when a business such as this, has idiot cashiers who conduct business in a gross manner. Screw them.";3;ErtKNkBDDXXynapuaZ4x7A

The burgers were ok.  The meat patties are paper thin (like a White Castle burger).  The taste ok, but if you're looking for a manly burger, go somewhere else.  The special sauce (thousand island) gave it a little flavor.  

I saw them cutting up fries when I entered so my hopes were high that at least they would be good.  Wrong!  They cut them so then, then overcook them.  They were too hard/done.  I've had shoestring potatoes that weren't that crispy.

Price was good.  Maybe that's why people love this place.";2;HIhPuKWV_r05-4w57nGFnQ

Well, that and the fact that we had a Free voucher to eat here compliments of MLife. We also had a B1G1 Free voucher from MyVegas and wanted to use it for our kids. (Well, because they're cheaper). However, under no disclosure, the kids price was not honored to use for the coupon. 

Anyhow, if your kids are over the age of 4, they are $22 and change for the Friday champagne brunch. None of my kids drinks champagne nor do they eat more than $5 worth. 

As for the food, I noticed some of the meats (ie. Flapmeat) was terribly dry and had burnt marks. Not char marks, burnt marks, there is a difference.  I'm only guessing but I would say this tasted like food from the night before.  There were also many other meats similar to that effect on our morning brunch. 

Other selections included oatmeal, salad bar, breakfast food like waffles, bacon, poached eggs, omelet station, and even crab legs. .  Selection is very limited for Brunch here, I would probably come later in the morning hoping they would have more choices. 

I would say for the GOOD, the cold food like Lox, Cheese, and Cold Cuts were excellent. The fresh blackberries/blueberries were fresh, though when it was out, they replaced it with Strawberries instead.  The kids got their milk in plastic disposable cups.  The champagne tasted quite good, though I just had 1/2 glass and had to drive after breakfast. The pastries like the croissant and some desserts (ie. bread pudding) were excellent as well.  I would say $30 for breakfast is a tad on the high side but unfortunately, we came on a Friday instead of a Thursday morning and that was the only choice available. 

The service here we had was quite good and we did leave our server a deserving tip. (Unlike other reviewers experiences)

Since we stayed here, parking (the new fee)  was already included in our bill and thought we would make the most out of our stay and try here.";5;GaTWkVy-pY6phZOqW6ykuw

I am in my mid 40's, newly engaged and was hoping to purchase my wedding gown from a local company.  I tried a few other boutiques in the area and was surprised how either extremely expensive the dresses were (10k+) or how unpleasant the folks helping me try to find a dress were.  That is when I decided to try Classic Bride.  I wandered into the store on a random Thursday afternoon, no appointment made or advertisement that I was coming in.  From the moment you walk into the store it is charming.  An old home converted into a bridal shop.  Rheva greeted me when I walked in and we discussed the wedding details.  She was amazing from the start.  I had a limited amount of time that day to try on dresses.  Rheva helped me get right into it.  We discussed my style and I shared the pinned dressed I preferred.  While I was picking dresses I liked, Rheva was also picking out styles that she thought would flatter my figure and style.  The dressing rooms (2) are two old rooms of the house.  They are setup perfect to try on gowns.  We found two dressed I loved in less than an hour.  I had tried on at least 30 before without a gown really feeling like the 'one'.  There was also no pushiness or arrogance to the team at Classic Brides.  I made an appointment to come back a few days later and try on a few more gowns.  I found the ""one"" at Classic Brides.  The team of folks, the personal experience, the quality make of the dresses and the down to earth prices made this bridal shop the right one for me.

If you want big box and non personal experience, go elsewhere for sure.  If you want a great, personal, experience Classic Bride is the place for wedding gown shopping.";0;SfTvaneXCtJO6OuxXU1TtA

Alex was our server and he was attentive, professional and had the qualities of a server you would want. Was there when you needed and not overbearing!! Never sat there wondering where my waiter was to get more water or anything. Timing was flawless!!

There were 6 of us, myself included, and we had sat at the patio. I went on a Thursday night at 7:30 for my birthday. We had made reservations beforehand, otherwise I don't think we would have gotten in because it was very busy when I arrived with most tables being full.
Here's what I had tried:

Lobster Fantasy Rolls
Beef Tacos
Some sort of shrimp with a chip underneath it
Double Salmon Rolls
Oysters (I'm not a fan of oysters in general but apparently they were really good)
Short ribs, regular and spicy

There was not one thing I did not like. I would love to go again. 

The main problem was the service. There was a lot of confusion, a lot of waiting, and some attitude. When we had first ordered, we had ordered the lobster fantasy and two orders of the tacos. Those came by very quickly. After that it went down hill from there. We had asked for another order of the lobster fantasy and they had taken about 20 minutes to get back to us with that. Everything we ordered from then on took around 20-25 minutes. Waiting for the dessert was just ridiculous..30 minutes for a small piece of cheescake!
The staff seemed to be confused at times because there was a point where a server came up to us and asked us what we'd like to order, when we actually already placed an order with our actual server. I had also asked my server for a fork long before the food came because I cannot use chopsticks. She never brought the fork out. The food was already at the table and I had to ask someone else who took an extra 15 minutes just to get a fucking fork. 
Our server had said she would take our menus from us once we placed the first order but none of us were ready to give it up yet. I'm not sure if there was a shortage of menus but she was very passive aggressive when we all told her we'd keep them. She had tried to take our menus multiple times throughout the night.
My friend also had a few questions about the bill as well as where to pay (we were on the patio so the moneris does not have a service up there, so we had to go down and pay). She simply wanted to know where and who we had to go to in order to pay the bill and the server just seemed like she didn't want to answer any questions and just wanted to get out of our presence. Everyone at the table noticed it. Unfortunately I do not remember their names but I will definitely be going again (SIMPLY BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS THAT GOOD), and when I do I will be sure to find out the names of these servers.";0;BymRS4q8-uc36wjTn1MoNQ

Not too much on the menu.  Just pizza, salad, and only a few specialty combos. 

For me, this is it. 

Add to it a great setting, pleasant and perfectly attentive wait staff, and a nice selection of beers, and you've got something pretty darned close to perfect.

Much like Coin-Op, Cobra was packed when I came here (on a Tuesday night no less).  To my great surprise, arcade play was free and drinks were discounted that Tuesday.  My brother and I quickly headed for the nearest joystick.  Tekken, Street Fighter, Frogger, NBA Jam, Donkey Kong, and on and on and on.  I think I counted three dozen different arcade games inside.  The bar area is an indoor/outdoor setup.  The beer selection is respectable, though perhaps they can expand it a bit in the future.  As for the games, they're apparently rotating new ones in and out all the time to see what folks love the most.  And if you check in on Yelp, you get 10 free game tokens (though as mentioned earlier games were free when we came on Tuesday).

Only a few tables were occupied. Our waiter brought us water right away before we could ask so it was perfect. I'm sure he's seen it hundreds of times... The need to hydrate in Vegas is of the absolute importance. Ha!

I opted for the bagel mania which is a grilled NY style bagel sandwich with bacon, eggs, ham and good ol' american cheese. It was delicious not only cause I was starving at the moment but the combination of ingredients was perfect. The cheese topped off the bacon, eggs and ham. And all those things were encapsulated in a perfectly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside grilled bagel. Delicious... It was just what i needed. It came with country style potatoes. That was pretty good too.

My friend got a rib eye steak and eggs. Loved it and scarfed it like it was the last meal on earth.... Satisfied customer.

have nine on the menu, and if your group is big enough, just go for a 
tasting of them all. If not, try the Harviestoun Bitter &Twisted.  It was one of the lighter tasting beer.

It was my sisters bday and we made reservations and they knew we'd be in. They did nothing to prepare for us coming. We got there and they set us down and it took 20 mins for us to even get a server, and extra 30 mins to get a drink. Also I ordered food and everyone else got there food and I never even got mine. The kitchen failed to make it, and by the time the server came back everyone was already done with their food. I got very upset with the server and by then I realized it wasn't her fault, she tried to do her absolute best. She had so many tables and parties and her manager knew that and hadn't helped at all, and that was probably the worst part. I can't fault a server for giving me their 100%, but when management fails to realize their servers tanking, and your sitting and talking, I think that's says a lot about the restaurant and management. We talked with the General Manager but I honestly I don't even think he cared. He just comped the entire tab and I think that annoyed me more, because that's not what I was looking for.

When we arrived , we were promptly seated to a poor attempt to replicate a  white linen table setting. The wine glasses were dull and water spotted from what I can only guess , were ran through a hard water dishwashe.The linen had food/liquid stains (I hope) and  ink pen markings (I guess from either the previous guest signing their check or a toddler drawing pictures). Black linen napkins ? Humph? After observing the white table covering..leaves you to wonder the cleanliness of the napkins to wipe up after the meal.
The wait staff.After being asked 3 times by 3 different  staff members, (each speaking just one decibel shy of screaming macaw), if we'd been to the restaurant before , rattled off scripted instructions for the dining service. The first staff member , a young female, with a high pitched voice , made no eye contact, had a bed head hairstyle  pulled back and had on a wrinkled shirt. We saw her as we sat through her pitch but  never again after that. In comes  Joshua our waiter (I'd hoped ). We listened again to the hurried script then  was awarded with a long wait before we ever received the water we 'd ordered . Then he disappeared. Only to reappear after awhile. .. Him -""Oh , yeah?! ...I will bring the garlic mashed potatoes and  the fried plantains ""  US- "" Oh, boy ! Can't wait!). I ordered a glass of wine. ..which Josh, appeared to almost forget ask if I would like to sample or ""taste"" before beginning to pour,  then catching himself to wait for my response after pouring. We saw him in passing once or twice times more, as he walked by our table during dinner, casually asking is everything OK. He really didn't give a damn. The food. The salad bar had a nice presentation but appeared picked over and unreplenished.
The  red meats were NOT seasoned, leaving you to look for a sauce or ""something "" to make it palatable and  
Dessert. I ordered Creme Brule . That was cold. A third staff member stopped by  our table to drop off/pu our bill...after my husband unsuccessfully attempted to raise  Joshua's attention  for the bill which for 2 people was  $145.00 , that included three alcoholic beverages,  plus  a generous $40.00 cash tip. Dining experience rated 2 stars. I hit the third star by mistake. Just want to add, I am a Vegas native and know when food is good and hospitality is exquisite.

The office was running about 40 minutes behind schedule and didn't give you a sense of your wait time.  This was frustrating because we had another appointment afterwards.  Once we were in a room the staff was there promptly.  The assistant was very friendly and the doctor listened to our concerns.  Though this was a body check, the doctor chose to take 10 total moles off my wife and I.   It seemed aggressive but considering our family history maybe this was appropriate or typical.  Either way, the shots and removal was straight forward and easy and I have a low pain tolerance.  I would recommend Dr Johnson just for his bed side manner.  The samples were sent off for testing which takes about two weeks.  Overall was a good visit.  Just needs to improve the front desk experience.

Update:  Before going to see them please read up on atypical moles.  1 in 10 people have them.  I have provided a link below.  This office likes to call them cancerous but scientific research shows these do not pose the risk as the office makes them out.   The office wants to treat these aggressively in my opinion needlessly.  Sufficient scraping is all that is necessary to remove even mild cancers.  Ask questions and know what your getting yourself into.

We had a large project of security screens on our new home to include front door and back. Our installers arrived on time and wasted no time getting started, but took the time to do it right. Arturo and Marcel were professional in every aspect of the instillation process. Once completed they cleaned up and thanked us for using them. The rating of 4 stars is because the office had put down the wrong amount of our deposit and the final bill was larger than it should of been. But Arturo and Marcel fixed the issue and everything was perfect. The new security system has added piece of mind to my family and looks great. We would highly recommend this company for security screens and request Arturo and Marcel as they are great representatives of this company.;2;iMth5ZRzK06xOJL5CwdHiQ

I didn't try the Spicy Tonkotsu myself but I think the Kuro tastes better than the Tonkotsu. The addition of the garlic oil makes a big difference in my opinion. It makes it much more flavorful. The
chashu was good but I didn't like the skin around it. The bamboo shoots weren't that good. Kinda bland. 

The complaints I'd have is that the soup is actually a little thicker and saltier than I'm used to. Just a little. Also the noodles are on the slightly softer side. 

I also tried their nitamago (flavored egg) which I think were very average. I'm very picky with my eggs so these eggs were too hard and cooked for my liking. Also a bit dry because of that. 

By the way, be careful with the chopsticks. They don't break very cleanly so just watch out for splinters. 

Price was pretty good. 3 bowls of ramen + 1 extra serving of noodle + 1 egg came out to be about $28 + tip.";0;k2TAP1NMIK3PAL3LmNEq0w

The decor was nice and clean, however it feels a bit stuck in the 80's.
I was surprised that there was only one other table that was occupied and two people ordering take out there when I was there -- this was 7:30 on a Saturday night. To be fair it was a Canada Day long weekend, but it just felt really odd and I was expecting just a few more people there.

The service was excellent. The waitor was friendly and very courteous and our water glasses were constantly filled throughout our meal.
The wait for our food was rather slow considering we were the only ones in the restaurant (the other table was finishing their meals when we arrived).

The food was a major let down, which is maybe why the restaurant was empty.

We had the Basil Duck which was drowning in a very salty sauce and the duck meat was rubbery and a bit over cooked. This was probably because the duck has been twice cooked (roasted and then stir fried).

The Mixed Seafood Green Curry came in a nicely flavoured sauce, however it could use more heat and it was very watery. The two pieces of mussels were cooked from frozen not fresh and I was horrified to see two sticks of imitation crab which fell apart in the bottom of the bowl as it was overcooked to death. Why would anyone put imitation crab in curry? That was something I would cook for myself when I was in university! There was no baby eggplant that was promised in the menu, which I was very disappointed as I love eggplant especially with curry.

The Grilled Whole Thai Snapper was the worst dish of the night. According to the menu it was supposed to be deboned and grilled with banana leaves which sounded really good, as I like the traditional fried whole snapper and thought that having it grilled it would be a nice alternative.  What came was a snapper that was full of bones, big and small, but what was worse was the snapper was not properly scaled and cleaned which makes for eating the fish rather difficult and ungraceful having to pull out bones and the many scales out of your mouth and on to the plate. I didn't see any banana leaf, but instead was a few large leaves of lettuce. The sauce was bit unusual tasting, as I think the lime leaves and lemongrass was a little overused.

All three dishes had the overuse of red and green peppers as the veggie ingredients, which was really disappointing and lacking in effort. I would like to see more substantial veggies used.  

The total tab for dinner was reasonable, however I think for the same price I could have a much better Thai meal at Coco Rice just down the street.";2;yaWnpONXlvdXbi36aKcznw

2922781;p8HvhJZ-_EHhmUVmZN15gg;2;2014-03-11;1;JYsUYfKoh7GUoYm58_GYqQ;5;"Five-stars for five reasons:

1. Service is amazing. Someone is always at the front door to greet you, lead you in, and ask if you need any of their recommendations. When it's your first time here, it really helps eliminate confusion and makes you feel less rushed to pick all of the great choices they have on their menu. You go down a line of people, each at their food stations and ready to prepare your meal! They've got quite a system lined up, and it totally works. You'll see what I mean. With that said...

2. Salads, sandwiches, and soups galore! I get the Try 2 Combo for $7.99 any time I go. It's gives you so much freedom of choice and is a dirt cheap deal for what you are getting. You can get soup and salad, or salad and a sandwich... You get it. The big plus? IT IS ALL HEALTHY. You also receive a slice of French bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry with the meal to top it all off.

***My recommendation is the Mango Berry Salad and the Pesto Chicken Panini. I am obsessed with both.

3. There is tons of seating. Booths line the windows and there are tables spaced out on the open floor. There is even a ""charge"" bar for your phones and laptops with little mini touch screens in front of you to play with. They have free wifi, although I haven't gone there for business- always for pleasure in the yummy food! Then again, I find it great  that customers are provided that option.

4. This is definitely a place for socialization for me, and is also family-oriented. I mentioned booths lining the windows because at each corner there are these huge booths that could probably seat 6-8 people at least! I like that fact for some odd reason. Maybe it's because any time I've been here, I am either catching up with friends, planning events to do later in the week, or sitting down with my other half and discussing how my day was. That's the kind of eating environment Zupas gives me- one where I can really sit down and ENJOY my meal.

5. I have never been disappointed, and sometimes that is hard to come by. I leave happy and full and.. plain old satisfied. ALSO, hard to come by. I am so glad its locations is so close to home for me. It has some competition for sure, considering the high volume of other restaurants located along Eastern Ave. But once you try it, you may think a little differently in that sense, and become a regular like me! 

P.S. Don't panic when you find there are no trash cans to discard your waste or areas to place your bowls, plates and utensils! I think they do this on purpose. It's their way of saying.. ""Don't worry about it, I've got it and I'll take care of it. Have a nice day!"" :)";3;-EW_Ff4RFWEBejF023nVHQ

Located next to Einstein Bagels in a small strip shopping center with Hallmark kitty- corner. 

Excellent customer service- the assistant opened the door for us (we had the stroller), got us refreshments- water or coffee, and told us that the jewelry buyer would be with us in a few minutes. There is a male security guard on duty. There is a TV playing a movie. There is a jewelry booth to the left (this is where we were assisted), and a secured booth area (clear glass) on the right. In the front, were additional seating, to accommodate more customers (4 more parties arrived after we were nearly done with our visit). 

The buyer was a nice professional man, who gave our little boy a soft bunny stuffed animal (that was very nice). He took the time with us- looked at each item and went through everything we had to show him (after the total was given to us, all we had to do was decide if we should sell and accept the deal; there was no pressure to finalize the deal, we didn't have to sell here if we didn't want to). We were able to finish out our transaction with the other assistant- she paid us the money, took one of our IDs, and gave us the receipt. Very happy with the exchange. (The buyer apologized for going to the next customer, but he explained that most of the staff had the weekend off for Easter. We were pretty much done, anyway.)";9;fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg

I was served my drink and had my food order placed , in less then 5 minutes even though it was crowded. 
Nothing takes the fun out of a bar experience more than having to wait an exuberant amount of time to get your drink, which was not the case for Olive Or Twist, even on a Friday night with easily 50 people in the bar.

My bartender Linda was no-nonsense when my glass was empty she was quick with another. 

I had the caprese salad and tomato basil soup.  The caprese was just fine by me. , The mozzarella was sliced thick, for a caprese it was a very hearty portion. 
 
Now for the soup it was thick and creamy but wasn't warm what so ever!!! Granted it was after 10pm but I would have liked it be served a little warmer. 

I saw some pretty amazing and tasty martini's being prepared. Olive Or Twist has a martini that is served with sprinkles rimming the glass I think I overheard that it was called the cake batter martini, fun and impressive!";5;V7uS5US4oTf-S9u36HJQCQ

I am exercising regularly since the high school, and am obviously picky about the gyms. Everything is important for me - professional level of the trainers, quality of the classes, equipment, facilities...

Totum has never disappointed me in more than two years. The place is clean and cared about, with excellent ""machinery"" inside. Staff knows me and my wife by name, they are cheerful, positive and fun people.

Professional level of ""my"" chiropractor (Rachel Assayag) and personal trainer (Andrew Steinfeld) is exceptional, and boxing classes by Antonio Lopez are always super-fun - can only recommend them wholeheartedly!

Important point: Not only those guys are great people, they are also a certified professionals - which is not a common trend across the gyms in Ontario. And this is another great value of Totum - people who work with your body here, really know what they are doing.

Another important thing: Totum is an actual ""sportsman's gym"", not just one of those threadmill-packed ""social clubs"". No doubt they have all the threadmills you may need, but the classes, sport medicine services and personal training at Totum are a pro-level thing. As such, Totum is not cheap by any means, but every dollar I spend there is worth it.

So if you are serious about being fit, Totum is probably THE only first-class choice here in Toronto. At least I have not seen anything getting even close to it. Good job guys - keep it running! :-)";12;z6VZrWNIAVw8Nv1w065tLg

First thing is first, you must, and I mean must, order the grilled Mackerel.  This was one of the most perfect examples of this dish I've had.  Even ones I had in Japan weren't this good.  It is a super simple thing, but some real skill to do it right.  We also had the Hamachi Kama, which was excellent as well.  A large one at that!  Very succulent and yummy.  We finished things off with the grilled eel.  Again very good, but in this case I have had better.  But still an excellent example of this dish.  

A good selection of saki at decent prices is another plus.  And excellent service.  I would so become a regular if this was down the street from me.  The only bummer is the day we were there they didn't have any sushi as the sushi chef was out a reception or something.  Which made me sad but give me a reason to come back to Montreal soon and try this place again.

Remember, Grilled Mackerel!";1;JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A

I have tried several Thai places around Cleveland and some in DC and I have to say Bangkok Thai is one of the best. 

First off, My family and I ordered take-out by phone. The young lady who picked up the phone at the other end was fast, precise, and polite. I placed an order for Beef Satay, Vegetable Pad Thai, Bangkok in Love (with extra peanut sauce), and Mango Curry with Chicken which would be ready in 20 minutes. 

When we arrived for our pickup, the food was already waiting for us. The kind hostesses reread our order to make sure everything was correct and went in the back to get us even more peanut sauce.

Digging in at home my family and I found the food extremely enjoyable. The Beef Satay was high quality and the spicy cucumber salad served with it was thick and had a complex flavor. The Mango Curry was delicious and when all ingredients were mixed together it offered the perfect balance of flavors, textures, and colors. The Bangkok in love was just as good and was packaged with the chicken and sauce separately as to not make the coating soggy. And the Pad Thai was the pice de rsistance. Normally I put peanut sauce on my Pad Thai but the flavor of this one was so exquisite that it needed no supplements. 

Overall, this restaurant is a hidden gem in Cleveland with excellent efficiency, atmosphere, and food.";0;obluHdhjSeg18RW5bLt3kA

She took our drink order and thankfully gives us time to look things over for our food order.

When our waitress came back with our drinks, she joked that she didn't take a sip...ok...haha...but maybe she should have. My $10 original margarita was nothing more than water and lime. There wasn't even a hint of a taste of tequila in it. My husband's $14 margarita wasn't any better. For the cost, I shouldn't have to guess if the bartender remembered to put tequila in our drinks!

We attempted to find out waitress so we could ask for our drinks to be remade. She was no where in sight. In fact, we couldn't get anyone's attention.

And luckily, we also had a very accommodating and friendly chef Tommy. Both the kids had lots of fun and they said Yokoso is their favorite restaurant now. Apart from entertaining the kids, Tommy was very careful with the vegetarian option. He handled the vegetarian food first so that there is no mix up of food while he took care of the rest of the hibachi chicken order. 

Coming to the food, I highly recommend the spring rolls. They are small in quantity, but very tasty. One hibachi chicken easily serves 2-3 people depending on your appetite. The fried rice is any regular fried rice.

I booked here a week before heading to Vegas on booking.com because of the hotel's advertised, ""Free Cancellation"" policy. The policy states that if you cancel at least a day in advanced they will not charge you any cancellation fees. I have family in Vegas, and I wanted to hold this reservation as a backup.

Two days before I arrived in Vegas I decided it would be better to stay with family, so I called the hotel to let them know I wanted to cancel. The person on the phone said they would take care of the changes and I left it at that, not thinking all of this would come back to haunt me.

At midnight on the day I would have stayed at the hotel, I get charged a HUGE no-show fee. I called the hotel to ask why I had been charged. They said three things: (1) there was no record I called, (2) cancellations can only be handled through booking.com, and (3) pretty much I'm out of luck. They showed no concern and tried to just shove me to the booking agency.

I contacted booking.com and the first thing they asked me was if I canceled with the hotel! Now I'm in this endless spiral between two entities that don't communicate with each other well, and I'm out a bunch of money. It's been a week and the best answer they gave me was ""we will investigate"". No names, no timelines, no reassurance. Terrible policies, rude staff, and in my case you get worse than what you paid for: NOTHING!";5;TGnCEKl4GYSQNeQ-fMfDHw

I specifically asked if they knew how as I've had this done several times at Blow and really liked the results. They said yes and booked me in. I showed up and the girl they had booked me with could only do French braids, she called another girl who tugged at my head for 15 min but she had no idea how to do it either, yet another girl was called over and she had no clue how to make the braid stand out like a corn-row either. This whole unsuccessful process took over 30min. Usually the girls as Blow get it done nicely in 10min. Lesson learned don't go here for braids or anything complicated simple blow drys are pretty much their limit.

The music was annoyingly loud in this place and every thing looked kinda dirty and I almost left immediately but a co worker told me this was good food so I just accepted my surroundings and didn't judge a book by its cover, I usually don't anyways. So biriyani is basically a seasoned rice with a different types of meat mixed in with it, I chose the boneless chicken. About 10 mins later and with a small headache developing from the noise my food was finally ready, the portion size was good, lots of rice with chunks of chicken hidden underneath. But the rice was kinda dry in quite a unappealing way like I was already desperate for water because of just the spices (I'm just a white dude so I can't handle spices well, don't judge) but having this dry rice wasn't helping either. The flavors were not overly appealing in anything, at least the chicken itself was pretty moist but really nothing special. The coriander yogurt mixture offered me a bit of relief and was pretty good except it was way watery. Meh... I could imagine that finding a better place for this type of food would change my overall impression of it but I'm not feeling inspired to look much after this experience.;0;U_O2Vr8hZxN-VnldSG1ePQ

We had to wait about 2 months to get an appointment but for that price we didn't mind. My massage was first and when I went there Megan informed me that she injured herself so she found someone else to sub in for her massage which was fine and the girl who did it was actually great! The bad part started two weeks later when my wife was up for her massage. Megan called the day before to let us know the injury was now worse and she had to cancel our massage. She also told us that she informed groupon to issue us a refund and we should be receiving an email to confirm. 5 days went by. No email no refund. So i reached out to groupon several times only to be told that they don't do refunds after 3 days. That's absolutely ridiculous if the vendor is unable to honor the groupon and we had to wait 2 months for our appointment anyway. So i decided to call Megan. Since then I have left 2 voicemails for megan over 2 weeks and received no response. Im my opinion thats fairly unprofessional and now im stuck with a groupon I can't use and wont be refunded for. Im hoping this review will encourage Megan to take action.;0;Syk2uHnw-QY7AIh4k4x57Q

Since I wasn't sure how spicy to get my food, our waitress offered to bring extra chiles with my dish.

I thought the food was good but it wasn't the best Thai food I've ever had. I thought the quality of the ingredients was quite high compared to most other Thai restaurants in Toronto.

I got the Roasted Chicken Croissant and my boyfriend got the Steak and Eggs. Both were delicious. The mango chutney went well with the cheese and chicken. I will say the chicken was a little dry, but I would order it again. Our server was very nice and pretty attentive. 

The second visit there did not go so well. I went with two friends on a Sundey around 1:30. Upon arrival, we were put on the wait list, which went by quickly. After seating and getting water and coffee, our server did not come back for what seemed like 15-20 minutes to take our order. I ordered the Croquet Norvegien with the egg (one of my friends did too) and the other friend got the Croquet Monsieur. Around 40 minutes of small talk and waiting for food, we started to become very hungry. One person, who was not our server, stopped by once to refill our drinks. We overheard a server say to her table that their kitchen was backed up and apologized for the wait. Our server never came back. We kept looking for her, but could not find her. After, an hour, she finally brings our food and apologizes for the delay. The food was all great and tasty, but the potatoes were cold. We were never offered some bread or an appetizer while we waited an hour for our food. 

Long story short, Le Petit Triangle has great food, but bad service. I would recommend going on off hours. It seems like the restaurant cannot handle a brunch rush. Or perhaps, this is their aesthetic since they are a french restaurant.";0;Zfnul8QQyX783uUZipVe8g

I got the southern heat that had buffalo sauce as the base and included red onions, chicken, onion , and green pepper. I like to have a kick to my food, so this was the perfect match for me. 

They also have a few flavors of gelato which is closer to the cashier, and I had a sample and I must admit it was rather satisfying.

105360;AV6weBrZFFBfRGCbcRGO4g;0;2014-10-18;4;7jnbnxniqzfKjyKexKOeBQ;2;"Here's an interesting comparison:
Wife & I had a business conference in Las Vegas, decided to also spend a few days at one of our favorite natural earth wonders, Zion National Park, about 3 hours from Vegas. 

The hotel in the tiny Zion Park town of Springdale honored our reservation for a king-bed room, which included a fridge, coffee/tea/hotpot, a full room service menu, an ample complimentary breakfast each morning, and full wi-fi. There's about 15 brand-name and mom-&-pop hotels in the little town outside the park, and all of them offer the same.

After 3 days in Zion, checked into the Luxor, a name raising expectations of something ""deluxe,"" on the ultra-modern, high-end-deluxe-hotels Las Vegas Strip. Not so much...

Oversold, can't give us the king room we reserved, gotta take queen instead. OK. Fridge in room? Nah. Coffee/tea/hotpot? Nope. Comp breakfast? Whadya think this is, the Ritz? 

How 'bout in-room Wi-Fi, gotta have Wi-Fi? 

Er, nope. We've got a long Ethernet cable for hardwire connection, but that's useless for our iPads. Wait...what century is this? A marquee hotel on the ultra-modern Las Vegas Strip, with every kind of digital & neon connection available - hell, even the Luxor pyramid lights up in sequence at night - and no Wi-Fi in the rooms?! ""Well we have Wi-Fi in the public areas, down at the casinos & restaurants."" Ahh, there's the tip off...

As confirmed by my wife and several other Vegas-savvy people (I'm a little slow about corporate manipulation,) the reason they don't have any of these basic in-room amenities is because THEY DONT WANT YOU TO STAY IN YOUR ROOM. Not even for a half-hour, enjoying a hot teas while researching tonight's restaurant on the Web. They want you downstairs, gambling and buying your coffee or tea at one of the 6 Starbucks. Pure corporate manipulation put before comfort first.

There have been close to 2000 reviews over many years for this place, and they can never raise above 2-1/2 stars. You get the distinct impression they've done nothing to spruce up the place or invest in better pay for their employees or basic amenities for the rooms. And, talking to the staff, you get the feeling they really don't give a toss, because they know the hotel will stay constantly booked anyway, whether they upgrade or not. Vegas don't care 'bout you, just your wallet.";12;W0mBfIE1la_OLSouckloZg
1156047;Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJ-ZimtnA;0;2016-03-03;2;xlHEXEEjnn2vYTEl0K1orw;1;"One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had - their customer experience is the very antithesis of the Ritz-Carlton. Came here for a conference and they were out of nonsmoking rooms so first offered to bring me an air purifier and move me to another room the following day, then offered to upgrade me to a higher-level suite for an extra $100/night. Why they couldn't give me a complimentary upgrade the way airlines sometimes do if they're sold out of coach seats is beyond me - clearly they were uninterested in any future stays by me. That was unacceptable to me so the manager somehow found a nonsmoking room that hadn't been listed in inventory. 

After I spent some time outside and came back to the room, I realized why - it smelled like smoke - faint, but definitely there. By the time I came to that realization, I was too tired to deal with it so called the front desk and asked them to bring in an air purifier in the morning. When I went back to my room around noon to check on the situation, it was clear the air purifier had done nothing to help with the smell, so I requested to be moved to another room. They didn't have anything available right then but told me they would put something on hold for me as soon as something became available. I told them I wouldn't be ready to change rooms until later that night because I was working and they said that was fine. Got a voicemail later that afternoon that a room would be held for me but only till 5, so I had to call the front desk again (and by the way, every time I called the front desk it was a 5-10 minute wait on hold) and request that it be held until 6:30, which was the earliest I could get there. They had to have a 2-minute sidebar with their manager before they said it was fine. Apparently none of these people are empowered to satisfy customers by themselves, nor are the managers allowed to interact with customers directly, since this sidebar occurred every time there was a problem.

When I came to the front desk to get the hotel key for my new room, they couldn't find anything at first. Another sidebar with the manager. Then when I asked to assess the new room before I checked out of the old room, another sidebar to get permission. Once I made a decision, I had to call the front desk (another 10-minute wait on hold). Are you getting the idea?

Fortunately, the new room smelled much better than the old room, so I did move my belongings. The shower in the new room, unfortunately, ran from barely tepid to not quite hot enough with the dial cranked all the way to the left, but by this time I had learned not to expect any sort of customer service, so I didn't even bother reporting it.

Needless to say, I will not voluntarily stay here if I ever come back to Vegas.";6;O1owVDyKZH312d7ajr2M3A

I asked her if I can get something for today and I have a Groupon for it, she tells me I had 120 days to use my Groupon and now I am trying to squeeze in at end time. How rude.. that is none of her business when I plan to use my groupon. Then she tells me she doesn't have anything for today [Sat] but will give me something for Tuesday afternoon which is when my deal expires. I told her I work and cannot make it on Tues afternoon. She tells me sorry I can't help you. Their website advertizes ""LAST MIN APPOINTMENTS"" as one of the top reasons to choose Ohana. I told her Thank You for making my decision easy of never buying a Groupon for your place again and sorry for the 11 customers I recommended that you are going to lose along with me. I bet if I called again and said don't have any deals or coupons, she would have given me an appointment for Saturday. This is purely unprofessional. I have been to Ohana before and loved it hence when I saw the Groupon I bought it and also recommended the salon to others. They are 50 mins away from my house and I was still willing to go to them. But if they treat me differently just because I bought their Groupon then shame on them. The reason people buy Groupons is to try out places they haven't tried before or if they are loyal to the place and get a deal every once a while.

My incredible husband said that he wanted to take me to dinner and a movie, so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and looked for Pho spots near us.  

Le Pho was the closest with more than a 3 star rating, so we hopped in the car and drove down.

We're not really frequent visitors to the downtown area, but Le Pho was easy to find, and parking was also easy to find.  Not a huge fan of the ""pay to park"" meters, but at least we were able to park close by!

The spot is clean and open, and we were invited to sit anywhere we wanted.  Our server stopped over and gave us menus, and brought over water. She was super polite for the entire visit.  I wish I got her name.  

When you check in on the Yelp app, there is a check in offer for a buy one get one free Iced green Thai tea.  I'd never had green Thai tea before, but this was delicious.  It had a very subtle sweet taste.  I'll definitely be having another one next time!

Happy hour is from 3-6, and we arrived at 4, so we were able to take advantage of one of the happy hour specials:  the Le Pho Roll for $4.  

This is absolutely delicious.  grilled 5 spice pork, basil, and other amazingness wrapped up in a rice noodle textured wrapper...we had to let it sit and cool for a moment, but oh man was this delicious!!!

We also ordered the traditional spring roll, which had shrimp, pork, veggies, and noodles.  Perfection.  The peanut sauce was on point as well.

As for the entrees:
Morgan had the oxtail pho.  The broth was a little salty due to the meat, but some herbs and sriracha fixed that right up. The oxtail was tender, and practically falling off the bone.  It was really good.

I had opted for the rib-eye pho, as it was the closes to the Pho Tai that i normally get.  This was exactly what I'd been craving.  The broth was so delicious, there was a TON of rib-eye meat in it, the noodles were cooked perfectly, and the addition of herbs and sriracha helped me to spice some of the sickness out. I actually have left overs for lunch today.

All in all, I was very pleased with our visit.   Service was great, and the food was phenomenal.  We both had 2 huge bowls of pho, 2 drinks, and 2 appetizers for under $50.  Not too shabby!!!

We will definitely be coming back!";4;renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A

Today january 2nd
I was so excited to find a place with xxs. 
 I wanted to buy a bunch of sweaters that finally fit me i was so happy.

I liked a skirt and the only size that fit me was on the manican.  i asked a woman if i could try it on because that was the only one my size.
 She walked to the manican then she said with a horrible attitude 
""if i take it off it means you are gonna buy it""
I said yes. i want to try it on. if it fits me i will buy it""
She said ""NO if i take it off is because you are buying it for sure"" so I asked how do i know it fits me?? 
She said try another skirt...
Other skirts were not the same i looked at my mom to see if i misunderstood and my mom said what?
So she repited. If i tajenit off the manican is because you will buy it i wont take it off just for you to try it.

I walked to another employee a male employee and i explained what happened i asked if that was true. He said"" no, but i can help you."" 

He walked to the manican and the woman emoloyee (which is the manager) told him not to help me! She said ""NO! If she wamts to try it she can search for anither skirt her size"" 

Does it makes sense? 
Why would i try another kind of skirt? 
They were not even same lenght. Not the same style!

Her attitude was so rude. I became so sad. What kind of costumer service is this??

So my family and i decided not to buy anything they lost a bunch of sales today each sweater was about 60 to 70dls we all had clothes we wanted to buy and we were so shocked their costumer service was this bad we said thanks but we wont take anything. Trying to stay calm.

She told me rude again that she was the manager. Which i already knew. Her attitude eas the worst of all.

If she had been nice about it, but the way she talked to me was so rude.
 I am not coming back and if this really are the rules at tommy H. Then i am not shopping there at all.";0;7NZBzH-PLW5jALkEWRN0Kg

This place is basically the Subway of sushi...which is a neat concept, but it isn't really much less than going to a regular sushi restaurant where I can be more confident that everything is fresh.

I only say that, because I got sick after eating here. It did taste good though, and maybe it was something else that made me sick...but their menu offerings are very peculiar and unorthodox. And most of the rolls are covered and drenched in extra stuff that is kind of a turn off. Your mileage may vary, I suppose.";3;hVRpLwPfgRaU6sllAHpnAw

We were originally gonna go to Charlie Palmer steak but  my sister and good friend totally changed my mind and I ended up canceling the reservation the night before and made one for here. It's place is deep in the MGM grand but not hard to find. When we go there, we were sat right away. The hostess was very friendly and asked how we were doing while she took us to the table. We sat down and looked over the menu. One server comes over and greets us and takes our beverage order. he was kind of a younger guy. then another guy comes over (a little older) and takes our food order. I got confused because I wasn't sure who was our server. I guess when the first guy came over, I wasn't listening to him introducing himself and his co-worker that was gonna take care of us. I think that's awesome they partnered up their servers at this restaurant, they can be on top of things. But anyway they bring out dinner rolls. They look like normal dinner rolls with sea salt sprinkled on top. I buttered it up and took a bite, it was a little toasty on the outside and so soft on the inside and oh my that salt goes so well with the roll. I didn't want to eat anymore because I knew I was gonna get full but I did anyway haha. We ordered the Hama Hama oysters and there were a few condiment. It was amazing and so fresh. We wanted to order another half dozen but didn't. We also ordered a Caesar salad, i didn't care too much for it. My scallops were cooked perfect! And my husband's domestic wagyu was like butter and phenomenal! We also got the whipped potatoes (delicious!) and risotto (okay). Souffl was yummy and they also gave my husband a complimentary dessert for his birthday. It was a panna cotta with berries.. That was amazing!! Definitely wanna come back!

Clearly their idea of good food is not my idea of good food.  Clearly some cross referencing should have been done.  While I ate here twice - once at lunch, once at dinner - my experience was varied and mediocre at best.  Lunch was the better of the two for a few reasons - I ordered it to go and I remembered to get my salad dressing on the side.  The worst thing ever is over dressed salads and generic restaurants are infamous for it.  This place is no exception because at dinner the next night I forgot and my side salad showed up a soggy mess.  My marinara at dinner was cream based which is disgusting and also extremely over dressed.  I would have been better off ordering no marinara and just the sausage and plain spaghetti noodles.

It is close to our home, so it is in the rotation of our go to places when we are feeling lazy or just don't feel like cooking. We only dined in once and the service was fine. The prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get. The menu is hit or miss, so if you find something that you like it is best to stick with it. I personally enjoy Happy Family (shrimp, chicken and beef), Szechwan Chicken and Chicken with Broccoli. These items come with steamed rice and are $5.75 for small and $8.95 for a large. I think a large entree is easily shareable if you get an appetizer or a soup to split as well. They do have a lunch special that ranges from $4.95 to $6.25 and includes an egg roll, rice, and a soup or hot tea if you're dining in. It is a good deal, but don't expect a ton of meat in your entree during the lunch special.;9;7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw

Came on a slow Wednesday evening about Happy Hour time, the place was pretty slow. I had my small (well behaved) dog with me (on a very short leash).

I walk to a table on the patio in the sunshine while my friend let the hostess know that we were sitting outside. She promptly rushed out at me as if I were trying to steall the patio decor, and told me that dogs were not allowed.

I apologized and turned to leave when the manager came out and directed us to a small table at the very edge of the property. Thanks for letting us stay......... I guess.

We settled in and ordered a bottle of wine (our waitress was no help and knew little about their wine selection). Ordered the humus plate with was also ""Just ok""

All in all.... I am still not happy with the brand after being to all the locations. 

And the humus made me throw up the next morning.......

Then tries telling us gambling on sports can get you in trouble . For one sports betting is the only game to consistently win at . And his slots are for drunks and to fill the bars pockets . Do not fall for his nice guy game . Do not play their slots you will not win . You don't have to throw your money away to get the workers to be nice to you . Because thats all they want . And 4.75 for a bottle of beer ? Please I can get free beer at any casino for betting sports anytime . If it was a classy place I would not have a problem . When we left he never said good bye .
